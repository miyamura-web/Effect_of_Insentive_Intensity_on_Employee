Unfair expectations - in the job during store manager time you are expected to anticipate things that are way beyond your experience. When you get to the grading period, you are left to sink or swim regardless of whether you have experienced something before.

They were not geared up to welcome new starters and I waited 8 weeks for the systems access in order to do my job properly. I then waited a further 4 weeks for my line manager to hand over jobs to me because they are the worst micro managers and don’t know how to delegate or manage their time. On top of that the blame culture within ASOS is the worst I have ever experienced, no one is accountable for anything with a lot of people looking to hide mistakes, blame someone else and talk down to you. I have spent the last 5 months being gaslighted by my boss who is incompetent and thrives off making people feel bad about themselves. The systems at ASOS are not fit for purpose and you spend 80% of your time waiting for reports to run/information to come back and even then you have to run 3 reports because the reporting system can’t handle the amount of lines you’re reporting on. The whole set up is a waste of people’s time and skills. I am fortunate enough to have never suffered from my mental health prior to working here but the way I have been treated at ASOS means I have suffered from the worst anxiety and panic attacks ever. There hasn’t been a day I haven’t cried or been treated poorly and the job isn’t worth it, the workload and the pay is the worst. Don’t put yourself through it.

Electrical outlets to charge electric cars are in the garages.","The political nonsense is more than enough to drive someone into a deep depression. I have worked in the industry for quite sometime. I have to say, AstraZeneca was by far the worst place I have ever been employed at. There was a new hire orientation every single Monday for full time people and new contractors. Meaning their turn over rate is just awful. I know several women who worked their for 6+ years, that were let go. Yet they are still hiring. They also promise all of their contractor that once they are full time their pay will increase, but it doesn’t. Instead, they will keep that person a contractor for as long as they can, then cut their contract. I have seen it happen with every single contract person I knew. Higher ups are extremely hypocritical due to the fact that they spout these values saying that they care about diversity and inclusion. All the while locally they tried and tried denying any group that has to do with the LGBTQ+ community. There is also a major racial and sexist issues. When a complaint of racism or sexism would be reported, higher ups would look the other way. Even if HR got involved, they know these people so instead of taking a reasonable action against numerous complaints, instead, they force the victim out of the company. Not the perpetrator! They would put the victim on PIP for no reason, they would pull work from other teams only to increasing the vics workload. If they email for time off months in advance higher ups will flat out deny it. I also attempted to move to several better positions. I went through all of the processes and even got verbal offer letters. However when the time came for the actual offer letters, I never heard anything. I never even got rejection emails. Instead, I would just meet the person they put into the position. Those people are truly monsters and they still work there to this day. Please please please whatever you do, if you are thinking about working here, think twice. If you are through the hiring process, get hired and find something else. Keep your head down and do not fully engage with anyone. The moment that you do, they will find something about you that they do not like and your job will be on the line. I sincerely kid you not."

The solution identified is very simple: cost reduction.
- Every year there is a project called Quantum that puts you at notice so you can apply for your own position, this generates a terrible atmosphere.
- Apart from that, roles are being moved overseas on a daily basis.
- Now BAT is suspending salary adjustments even with an amazing year in order to profiteering from the COVID situation.
- For those who remain, the workload is insane and you are expected to work 12 hours a day in order to achieve the targets set
- High-level management now uses very low-level tactics that if you don't deliver unachievable targets you will be part of the next wave of redundancies.
- Next point is the complete lack of planning before these role movements, it is kind of normal to have employees leaving the company and then a consulting firm doing the same job but at a higher price, just for the management of the area show he was able to reduce some number of FTEs even if spending more money.
- If you are coming from abroad, make sure to include a stabilization clause on your contract. I saw too many times people moving from other countries to the UK on a working visa just to be made redundant 1 after, even with very good performance ratings.
- Finally, in an act to spit in the face of employees and show how committed to cost reductions the company is, the CEO switched his company car from a BMW to a Bentley."

- Extremely disorganised processes. Nobody on the team actually understands the fundamental step by step processes needed to execute a project. It's frankly alarming. There is really no proper structure anywhere (at least in the vaping division)

Regarding performance, the vast majority of IT projects fail miserably. When I was working in that department, the joke was that BAT were the world champions of failed SAP projects. The reason is, failure is not seen as an issue in that department, confidence and arrogance are valued much more than competence. And, of course, your ethnicity: woe be to those outside of ""CANZUK"" + (white) South Africa.

As a result, the culture is based on blaming others for one's own failures, and hijacking your neighbour's successes. People at the top are low-level technicians whose only skill is to relish in abject subservience to their superiors, unable to see the big picture while convinced they are ""leaders"". Bullies flourish within BAT IT department, and attain the highest positions.

And, as ""BAT has too much money"", the way vendors are selected and managed is particularly worrying. Again, they are not selected with the business' interests in mind. More expensive, less performing vendors are preferred over more efficient and cheaper ones, even when the choice implies a huge risk to operations. Or useless technologies are purchased to allow the IT ""architects"" to garner their resumes with that specific skill. Sometimes vendors are selected based on the ""cultural fit"", meaning the nationality of the vendor - pure Brexit style.

If you have any principle or talent, avoid at all cost."

All the benefits that they provide are the most minimal it can get, do not expect more, from the minimum salary offered to avoid OT expenses for audit profession to the minimum number of leave days given as recommended by MOM. Pay for your own snacks at the vending machine. Guess one should be contented with the free flow of plain water and soda biscuits. Salary package is definitely not transparent and very unfair to those that are not locals. Most people joined because the HR processes the application VERY quickly and promptly. The higher management is just ridiculous and changes their policy as and when they see fit, without taking into concern their employees, which of course can be expected considering the higher management only does things that are beneficial to them.

the company has a lot of potential in the right hands.","all levels of the the Clinical Operations team are prone to frequent burnouts due to:
1. inefficient management
2. increasing appointment numbers without fixing backlog first
3. general feelings of being unsupported 

there are clear conflicts of interest if you ever want to go to the HR team about the management team, as they protect their friendships with each other rather than the experience of employees. 

management has a frequent bad habit of calling sudden and urgent meetings to the whole team without any context, causing associates unnecessary stress, and often make insinuations that there is someone to blame in those meetings. one may also find themselves not receiving any negative feedback until they are called into a private meeting with their senior associate, in which another member of management will actually be there to tell you that you're doing a bad job. 

changes to internal clinical processes or employee policies are always framed as ""improvements"" when in fact they are detrimental to patient care in terms of workload or makes having a work-life balance even more difficult. 

they even say that they ""care about your mental health"" and yet when you tell them about your issues, they tell you to take advantage of the free counselling sessions (which book up almost immediately from all the depressed/anxious employees) or make you jump through hoops of trying to get accommodations to the point where you give up and they say ""okay let us know if there's anything we can do to support you :) "". 

They advertise that there are growth opportunities, but you have to have been in your position for at least 6 months before being considered as an applicant for a promotion. Even then, they may often hire externally for higher up positions citing ""business needs"" rather than valuing their employees' professional growth. 

you get 20 days of vacation BUT you can only use them at a certain time, ie. you cannot go on vacation during the summer or the winter holidays or anytime that people usually take vacations, OH and you're not allowed to carry over your unused vacation days to the following year. so you probably have to take your vacation during September/October/November. 

there is so much wrong with the company from an employee standpoint. they exploit their employees and gaslight you into thinking you're doing it ""to help all Canadians have access to healthcare"". the irony is that they push their employees to start using healthcare for the anxiety and other mental health issues they cause."

- offers benefits and 4 weeks vacation and competitive wage for entry-level position","- Technology is lacking and not adapted well to the Canadian health care system leading to inefficient processes and delayed delivery of care to patients.
- Scaling and expansion continue at rapid rate rather than focusing on improving and fixing the technology, leading to an increase in workload at the expense of employees and patients.
- Despite repeated feedback from employees, management often gives the message that ""it is what it is"" or ""we're working on it"" but offers little reassurance or transparency in terms of actions being taken to address concerns. Feedback is sometimes met with defensiveness instead of acknowledgment. The company's response to the other Glassdoor review is a good example of how concerns are not really fully addressed.
- Management promotes the message that working hard and taking on extra tasks will lead to further opportunities but when it comes to giving actual promotions, the hiring team is quick to tell you that the credentials listed on your resume (i.e. external experience) are what it takes to ""meet the company needs"" rather than proven internal experience and performance. Moving up in this company can feel like a moving target to those hoping to grow their career at Babylon and leaves hard-working employees feeling used.
- Solutions to tackle high workload and backlog of patient care related tasks put forth by management often involve increased monitoring rather than steps to address employee stress/burnout and patient safety, ultimately leading to further stress and a feeling of not being valued as individual employees.
- Many (entry-level) employees feel overworked, under-appreciated and their feedback discounted. Management tries to address these concerns with occasional words of appreciation/encouragement but it has come to a point where employees need to see real action and not empty words.
***Most importantly, acts of workplace racism, harassment, and bullying are not met with proper action. Rather than applying company policy, professionalism, and proper research on reducing harm to victims and increasing workplace safety, they have deflected blame and allowed personal relationships to bias their decision-making in these matters. They have not taken appropriate steps to ensure victims and witnesses of workplace bullying and harassment feel safe at work and have also not taken steps to ensure such behaviors will not happen again, resulting in severe negative impact to those affected."

But it's up to these orgs to reduce their cost to the end-user. Where is the data that shows that we are closer to achieve our mission?
- Senior leadership has no experience with tech - The CEO and other people in C-Suite has no experience with tech or managing product organisations. Their decisions are random and dictatorial creating a chaotic environment.
- There is never time to build the right thing - The business is led by the commercial team and all their short-sighted deals. They decide what goes to product roadmaps. Product teams then need to work in a rush to make sense of the commercial deal and try to build a solution that either meets the user needs or the partner needs. What do you think a CEO who is ex-Goldman Sachs is going to prioritise?

For context, I have never worked at a company for less than 5 years... My last company was a very successful start-up, so I can handle a disorganized org that needs people to roll up their sleeves and do the hard work. This was anything but a good challenge. The benefits are basically nonexistent. There is no bonus program, so your salary is the only comp you will get for the year and there is no additional compensation for top performers. There is also no formal review process so the only way you can get a raise is threaten to quit unless they pay you more. Their health care benefits are so expensive ($2k/month for a small family) that many employees opted to be uninsured. The company has no vision or business strategy. Many of the people who run the company have nepotistic relationships with the CEO (family members, former coworkers, former nanny for his children!). They are overpaid and under-qualified. This company is the most political and toxic place I have ever worked. I was being actively bullied by a VP. She spent working hours scheduling 1:1s with colleagues with the sole intent to badmouth me. When these colleagues came to me to report these incidents, because she was saying such atrocious things about me that they were made uncomfortable, I reported it to HR and they did next to nothing. Why? Because this person has a close personal relationship with the CEO. What was my crime? Who knows! I wanted post mortems when launches failed (and every single one did!). That was somehow seen as a personal attack and resulted in a vendetta. The CEO is actively looking for an exit event and therefore does not care about improving anything within the organization. He even knew about my bully incidents (because my manager told him) and he did nothing. There is also a total lack of transparency. Babylon lost valuation during the time I was employed there and no one said a word. Not to mention, the contracts we have with clients are leaving us bleeding cash in every state we launch in. Almost none of them are profitable or have a path to profitability. There is also bound to be some catastrophic regulatory or compliance incident here as there is no clinical oversight. Want to schedule back-to-back consults with a clinician to drug shop and get the same prescription from multiple doctors? You can absolutely do that, because there is nothing before, during, or after the consult to stop you. Want a Schedule II drug? The clinicians aren't supposed to prescribe these, but there is nothing to stop them. If Babylon was bigger in the US, TechCrunch or another tech publication would tear this place apart as it's on track to be the next Theranos or WeWork. I have never been happier than the day I gave my notice and I will look back on this time as part of the dark cloud that was 2020."

Peers and “doers” in the company are some of the best and brightest I’ve ever worked with, although those talented people are now choosing to leave in their droves to find a place where they will be better appreciated.","There is a complete disconnect between the teams in commercial, product and engineering resulting in constant internal bickering and “retros” that never see the light of day after they’ve been churned out. They serve no purpose other than to provide fodder for the inevitable witch hunt to identify the “guilty” party in whatever is the latest drama.
The highest turnover of management I’ve ever seen coupled with perpetual re-orgs and inability to stick with any form of strategic direction for longer than a few months has resulted in an organisation pushing and pulling in different, and mostly opposing, directions.
The above, plus many other reasons, results in the constant feeling of having a target on ones back and the thought that anyone will be discarded when they have burnt out and served their purpose.
I am truly sad that I’m writing this as I had high hopes for the company and my place within it. My, and l’m sure many of my colleagues, main reason for sticking it out is the promise of shares, although they appear to be decreasing in their value with each passing day."

Probably the most stress and the most hours I have ever worked in my entire career; 52 hours norm every single week with no overtime, and management 'expect' even more. (Inference that you are a slacker if not doing 60 hours a week). I am genuinely scared to take annual leave due to the workload I will have upon return!"

Came across this website to see the reviews in the hope BB got better. Well, unfortunately not! 

I can confirm every negative review on here starting with:
- Poor management and backward people from the 18 century still being hired in business.
- Toxic environment offices, as everyone thinks they're a hotshot & everyone is the boss.
- Senior managers get promoted & hired not because they deserve it but because they know each other from somewhere else
- No training and lack of professionalism.
- They keep hiring old people & cowboys who can't run basic stuff on PC starting with the DC system to basic Microsoft Office programs.
- Everyone likes talking on everyone on their backs
-HRs don't do their jobs properly and they're just muppets controlled by senior management preferences or on the external agencies at best!

The list can go on & on, in short, it's a place to run away from."

Great overview of financial players
Decent - but not superb - corporate benefits (pension, art galleries access, healthcare)
It looks good on your CV if you're smart and are able to sell it well afterwards (and if you're lucky and your future employer hasn't already heard of this department)
Diversity and inclusion, lots of respect for culture/belief/sexual orientation/ideas, diversity is really promoted here, and this is fantastic.
It's a safe company to work at if you don't care about the meaning of your job, they will never fire you (unless you do something really bad)","First and foremost, the Analytics and Sales programme, is basically a call-centre. They will try and fancy it up as much as they can, and sell it to you..but it's essentially a customer service call centre, like that of a mobile phone carrier. okay? You will find yourself lying to yourself and telling your friends that you're an ""aNaLyst iN FiNaNce"" but you're simply a little replaceable tool in the decadent Bloomberg Terminal customer service support..
The company is obsessed with data and micromanagement, especially the Analytics (ADSK) department. They will drive you insane and push the limits of human respect and decency. They will be abusive to you. Read as many positive reviews as you want to convince you otherwise, you will still end up feeling this way or being in denial and paying the mental consequences later.
Micromanagement to the extreme, if you go to the toilet, there is a statistic for the time you left your desk and this will impact your salary review/bonus/progression. 
Lots of politics, if you play the game well you get away with it and succeed, if you're honest and don't cheat, you will never make it. Only smart cheaters win here, not the hard working people.
No work from home or other office flexibility, I almost lost my only ID once because Bloomberg wouldn't let me work ONE day from one of their offices in my Country of origin. At the same time they go on social media and brag about their network of offices and flexibility to explore regions and the world/rotational scheme...it's all a lie.
The company also promotes the idea of moving intra-department and growing your career and skills, they blocked me 3 times from moving department, they kept me captive in 2 different departments in the same way, and this is because all senior members of the team left and abandoned ship for something more decent than this ""job"".
Clients. Ohhh the clients. Clients verbally abuse you, everyday. EVERY. DAY. They shout at you on the phone, they insult you via the tickets on the customer service. They call you R word, they call you stupid. They threaten you. Have fun if you join.
Your schedule is pre-fixed, you have no power over it, you always have to be punctual and on time otherwise management will intimidate you and tell you off, yet if a ticket/client request/meeting overruns your lunch or your end of day, you have to lose your own time, and often lose lunch.
This was literally the worst experience in my whole career, many many colleagues lost their minds, some got depressed, some quit without a job, some believe in the corporate dream and are still lost in The Matrix and will end up staying in BBG for the rest of their lives with £2k increase every year, too tired and lazy to try move to a normal company.
Company culture is a joke. HR is a joke, their default reply is ""sorry, this has to be discussed with your Team Leader”. But the TL have no power, rules always prevail.
Mike Bloomberg spends 500millions on Facebook ads for his hopeless presidential campaign and his company hits 11bn revenue, yet his firm pays offensively low salaries, low end of year increases, low bonuses, doesn't provide you with hardware to work from home with, no mid-year salary reviews (even if you change drastically role and seniority in April, you’re stuck on the same salary until March of the year after), sales doesn't get paid commissions!!"

The only thing they care about is you doing the helpdesk. You can also volunteer, go to events and doing different stuff to waste your time at work.

There are some learning opportunities.","If you are ambitious don’t go there. The job is absolute nonsense. The team leads and the managers are there because they are not capable of doing actual jobs, so they find themselves in “managing” and micromanaging. For example, my team leader once was checking how I am sending an email to someone (not client). This job completely shattered my mental heath and self worth, I was so unhappy. And no, the problem was not me, since I left I am doing fine and don’t hate my job that much at any times despite any difficulties that I may have.

My advice to people who are stuck there and afraid to make a move: the earlier you do it the better for you. And no, free nuts are not a reason to keep a bad job. No one’s job should be as boring, annoying and self-humiliating."

I was gifted items as a leaving present which was lovely","I did a large amount of overtime whilst working for Boots and was paid incorrectly majority of the time which I advised the manager of most months and I had to wait until the following month to be paid the hours. At one point, all my unpaid accumulated to 40 hours and my manager told me they were going to have to pay me half this month and half the following month as it wasn’t in their budget to pay me it all in one month aka they were only allowed to spend a certain amount of funds on overtime each month. I declined this as they should pay any hours you are owed immediately however they still did this anyway and stated there was an error. One manager told me I might have to lose a weeks holiday as they didn’t have enough time to give it me, after seeking advise from Acas and advising them of this and that they weren’t legally able to do this, they immediately backtracked and gave me my holiday. I asked for a copy of my contract and was never given one. They wrote my hours of work down wrong one week which I told two managers about. When I finished at my correct time, I advised the Fire Marshall I was leaving and was confronted my the manager the next day for ‘leaving early’, he got quite confrontational to the point I was in tears and made a complaint to his manager. When I left, they unlawfully deducted £400 from my wages, something which happened a lot with other employees whilst I was working for Boots. When I queried this with a new manager they said they had checked with Payroll and it had been calculated correctly. I wrote a complaint to the regional manager who apologised and had a supervisor take over the issue who advised me Payroll had done it incorrectly and the new manager hadn’t even called Payroll."

If someone gets Covid in your practice you’re expected to carry on as it’s ‘Covid secure’ though they don’t take the PPE rooms where you all change together or the staff rooms and back areas where everyone walks around without a mask talking, into account. They’ve probably all had it and been spreading it around.
Uniforms are horrible.
Optometrists can do whatever they want especially long serving ones and you’re supposed to pick up the abuse for them running late/putting in late holidays requests which are granted/having to rearrange the clinic due to the customers booking with the call centre who are awful and have no idea what they’re doing.

Be under no illusion about working in optics. There is a lot to learn so it should not be seen as an easy option or a stop gap until something else comes along.

There was good discounts on boots products and 70% off prescription glasses/sunglasses if you needed it. 
The sick leave and maternity pay was good. In general we had lots of good choices for frames and lens’ with customers. I really enjoyed the job when I first started as it felt like we really cared about people’s well-being.","Towards the end of my time here during the pandemic when they decided not to bring managers back into store, optical assistants were being overworked and underpaid; being expected to do a store managers job for zero pay increase this led to incredible stress and a day where my entire team cried because of how overwhelmed they was. 
Upper management were constantly making changes to the prices and procedures without consulting their staff on the ground which led to things that were not beneficial to the customer or the staff which clearly someone sat in an office who had no experience of optics had designed.

Lack of training meant there was many who could do one thing but not another and it led to a high turnover of staff as they felt inadequate when they couldn’t do things that they could if they had just had some training. 

The wage for the job you was doing was very small and actually one of the lower paying of opticians. No bonuses or commission made it feel as if it wasn’t worth it. 

The uniform was one of the worst things about the company, cheap polyester uniform that was constantly splitting or tearing and once it did break you could be waiting months before getting a new set. A customer once described it to me as looking militant and I couldn’t disagree with them. 

In my time there plenty of staff left but non were replaced which meant at times you had three people for three clinics and as soon as you had a walk in it meant everyone was rushing around without being able to give proper attention to the customer.

The rule of being stood up all day meant that we looked as if we was doing nothing when customers walked in when actually we had ten jobs in hand that we couldn’t deal with just so we looked as if we were ready to go for the next customer. 

If there is jobs going at any other opticians I would go there over boots, their work politics gets to be too much and you feel very inferior within the company; there is zero room for progression at most points but especially now as they are making staffing cuts."

James Arrow (MD) and his team regularly holds video conference meetings with all practice managers, and doesn't shy away from answering difficult questions thoughtfully and meaningfully. Although the answers are usually, we can't afford to invest in that, it isn't a priority, or it's on the roadmap within the next five years (and has been for the last fifteen), the honesty is appreciated. 

Reasonable work life balance, although taking on more stores and more responsibility has changed that, it is still better than many other retail/optics management roles. Can switch off emails and ignore calls on holiday without repercussions, and little to no contact after normal business hours outside of genuine business emergency.","Very disordered, in the next couple of years Boots Opticians needs to either rapidly shape up, or they will be facing the end. Senior leadership do seem to know what their problem areas are, but seem unwilling or unable to face into them. 

Customers complain that we're too expensive and our prices are too confusing, so they reduced the price of some of the lenses, increased the price of others as well as most of the frames and added an extra tier into the pricing, making the end result more expensive and more confusing! 

Technology across the business is hugely out of date, we're still using paper records like it's 1993! The stock keeping system is ancient and unreliable, nobody (even loss experts) understands how it works. The PMS is a dangerously buggy mess that will bring up incorrect patient data, lose appointments and orders (literally every patient is has a duplicate file due to a mistake someone made about a year ago that nobody can work out how to fix!). The recall system was broken for around a year, with reminders sent randomly to the wrong patients and they either couldn't invest or couldn't work out how to fix it. The intranet is a broken joke where searching brings random results and half the links are broken. IT is outsourced as cheap as possible, so when issues come up (all the time), you are going to spend half an hour on hold, to some poor guy who speaks little to no English, and just needs to close the call as fast as possible regardless of if your issue is fixed or not. 
So the business obviously invests into online rota's that don't talk to the (outdated) payroll software and email accounts for OCs? Solving absolutely nobodies problems. 

Lack of critical maintenance points to a worrying cash flow problem in the business as a whole. Shops themselves, barring a few flagships, are uniformly shabby. Broken windows, leaking ceilings and damaged fixtures take months to be fixed, if at all. I've had parts of my store held together with duct tape for several months until maintenance can afford a fix. Critical testing kit is left out of commission, costing the business a fortune in lost revenue, for want of replacement parts. 

You're expected to deliver a premium product and service on a shoestring budget, with none of the tools or processes to deliver that. And when the half-baked processes inevitably fall down across the business, it isn't the fault of Nottingham where the processes were written, or the lack of investment has come from - it is individual practice managers and their teams who get it in the neck. 

Area management seems disordered and/or disinterested. Some good leaders are moved on or demoted, while others who seem utterly useless persist and are promoted beyond any logic."

Boots-Opticians,2021-01-20, Optical Assistant,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","London, England, England",2,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,x,x,x,Overworked & Underpaid,"I worked with a lovely team who had years of experience and very much enjoyed optics and the new things I was learning each day. There was good discounts on boots products and 70% off prescription glasses/sunglasses if you needed it. 
The sick leave and maternity pay was good. In general we had lots of good choices for frames and lens’ with customers. I really enjoyed the job when I first started as it felt like we really cared about people’s well-being.","Towards the end of my time here during the pandemic when they decided not to bring managers back into store, optical assistants were being overworked and underpaid; being expected to do a store managers job for zero pay increase this led to incredible stress and a day where my entire team cried because of how overwhelmed they was. 
Upper management were constantly making changes to the prices and procedures without consulting their staff on the ground which led to things that were not beneficial to the customer or the staff which clearly someone sat in an office who had no experience of optics had designed.

Lack of training meant there was many who could do one thing but not another and it led to a high turnover of staff as they felt inadequate when they couldn’t do things that they could if they had just had some training. 

The wage for the job you was doing was very small and actually one of the lower paying of opticians. No bonuses or commission made it feel as if it wasn’t worth it. 

The uniform was one of the worst things about the company, cheap polyester uniform that was constantly splitting or tearing and once it did break you could be waiting months before getting a new set. A customer once described it to me as looking militant and I couldn’t disagree with them. 

In my time there plenty of staff left but non were replaced which meant at times you had three people for three clinics and as soon as you had a walk in it meant everyone was rushing around without being able to give proper attention to the customer.

The rule of being stood up all day meant that we looked as if we was doing nothing when customers walked in when actually we had ten jobs in hand that we couldn’t deal with just so we looked as if we were ready to go for the next customer. 

If there is jobs going at any other opticians I would go there over boots, their work politics gets to be too much and you feel very inferior within the company; there is zero room for progression at most points but especially now as they are making staffing cuts."

Each case / project has been a totally unique tech stack and problem to solve. Because we are a consulting firm, there is a good mix of heads-down coding and work along with client facing work. Platinion is often brought in by clients to build prototypes and MVPs for projects which makes the work faster paced and I think more fun. 
Platinion has a bit less intense style compared to the regular consultants at BCG, where there is pressure to be promoted or leave every 2 years.
We operate somewhat independently from BCG but still have all the perks and benefits of working at a top consulting firm. Perks that include the best health insurance ($5 copay for EVERYTHING), first class flights for flying, and incredible office spaces (the NYC office serves* breakfast and lunch every day with ample snacks and free Joe coffee throughout the day)

*going into the office and all office services are of course on pause for 2020 due to COVID
I trust our Platinion leadership and especially the BCG leadership; the BCG North America team I feel has done a great job handling the tumultuous year 2020

Consulting can feel rather isolating with traveling to clients and being on different teams all the time. BCG does a great job of recognizing this and making efforts for team and office events and culture. (They do a much better job at this than my former employer, a large IT consulting firm)

I'm not sure if this is available for Platinion but on the BCG side, when you are ready to leave or are told to leave, you are given a 3 full or 6 half months salary to seek your next position, as well as assistance from career services in your search.","The pace and workload can sometimes be high, but because cases have set end dates (usually at most a few months) there should always be a light at the end of the tunnel. 

From an engineer's standpoint, traveling every week to a client like a consultant felt like too much. But with COVID we're obviously not traveling at all and I am guessing that client travel will lessen or change dramatically after this.

The actual salary is a bit lower than what a software engineer in NYC could find, but other perks and benefits, particularly the health care, help to make up for it.

Platinion had to grow rather quickly and made for some hectic and maybe-not-as-thorough recruiting .

This year has especially brought to light shortcomings in Diversity and Inclusion among the nation and BCG is no different. Platinion and especially engineering lacks Black representation and has made strides with but still behind in gender diversity. This year has felt like all the right acknowledgements of the issue have been made; BCG has launched many efforts including 'inclusion accelerators,' millions of dollars in in-kind pro-bono work and actual monetary contributions to causes. But it will take time to tell if a significant positive difference is made."

The green card policy sucks big time. There is no clear policy that is communicated to the employee. It is very much left at the manager's behest. Managers usually bait and switch the employees using the green card as a tool to keep them. HR is not helpful in resolving such matters. 
Overall, this is a very top down company. It talks a lot about diversity and equality, but if you peel away the layers , none of it is being practiced, in reality. In my case, my manager kept promising a green card filing for 2.5 years without actually filing it, but always making sure to 'bait and switch'. HR will deny any meetings or calls. Immigration team will work in collusion.
To summarize:


No diversity at leadership that can understand issues related to immigration
BCG managers do not fully comprehend issues faced by immigrants
BCG leadership (at Director+ levels) have very little training about the immigration process in this company 
HR does not fully comprehend issues faced by immigrants and are not very helpful
The Green Card process does not provide transparency to the employees, leaving them with zero control of their own situation
 Needless to say, the different players in the BCG immigration team have any accountability to employees as the process itself doesn't call for it"

The sales was stagnant before the new designer and it is a struggle to gain new clientele with the new design direction.

result of this is they made the retail staff's life really hard.

1, you get all these new expectations and new duties while your pay stay the same.
2, retail staff get all the blame if the sales is not good.
3, You are constantly policed by managers, visiting head office people on whether you followed every steps they wrote in the customer journey handbook even it is sometimes not very natural.
4, Aggressive sales style expectation. They want you to jump on the customer as soon as they walk in and they want you to ask them to buy everything available in store regardless what they are looking for.
5, They want you to capture all customer's contact details even they are just browsing.
6, No progression in this company, you need to wait 4-5 years to just progress the the next level which only pays for 5k more. They always bring in outsource talent.
7, The HR encourage retail management to be mean and harsh to staff so if the long serving staff don't like the changes they can leave the company themselves. Absolutly toxic work environment. 

8, Last but not the least. Burberry as a big FTSZ 100 cooperation machine. Its lack of agility in reaction to changes are slow and conservative and not suitable for a ever so changing world."

The customer service was moved from London to Leeds and it wasn’t sale-orientated and this was made clear thoroughly the hiring process. No commission, no sales target. Only vouchers based on personal sales, understandable SLAs to respect for quality and response time. This was completely overhauled as the London management left after a few months. The new senior management decided to heavily push on sale with personal targets while putting in place a heavy quality systems that managers would never be able to respect themselves if they were on the phone; still no commission or incentives apart from gift vouchers (CS annual revenue targets shot from 10m to 30m, for a bit of context). Bear in mind you would earn more or less 20k a year, so must be amazing to be able to purchase a couple of cashmere scarves with vouchers instead of getting paid fairly. 

Burberry now pays for the living wage (which is great, right) and English speakers’ salary is around 19k. Language speakers be aware: you will be hired to speak English and a second language for the same money. Yes, this is correct. Native foreign speakers are expected to speak 2 languages while being paid as much as those who can only speak 1 language (unless you consider fair £500 difference, a year). Good luck asking for a raise and no wonder the turn-around is extreme. New positions may arise but they are created to suit specific people, as they already know who they want to give promotions to."

Staff constantly disappear from one day to the other. Of course no exit interviews for those.
Do not dare having a brain and speaking up in this company. Be a sheep and you will succeed. 
In this company, it is not how good you are at your job but how well you get on with the assistant manager. Your direct line managers will never stand by you however good you are.
Lots of weird people in this company..people who have been in the company for very very long who behave so strangely and constantly look for an opportunity to comment negatively on others.

HR were useless when it came to conflict with co workers. I have left recently because of this, after three years of working in my store and constantly explaining my issues with a particular co worker to new managers and nothing getting done i ended up making a grievance against her in hopes that i could avoid 1 on 1 shifts with her. i gave detailed dates and times of incidents to which they wanted more, which i did. they then did not follow protocol and took far too long to get back to each of us. in the end they dropped my case and dismissed me saying i hadnt got enough evidence and also commented on certain parts of my grievance that were not the core issues and used that against me to ignore all my real issues with bullying and passive aggressive behaviours she had shown towards me my entire career there. 

most stores are under budgeted to an unrealistic extent leaving us understaffed most the time despite being thousands over spent every month. 

managers can work 70 hours and only get paid for 40. a part of their job is to fill in when needed however seeing my most recent manager work a month straight with no days off during covid - even open until closes i could see the company for what it really was, zero compassion.

The level of stress I felt was nothing compared to my boss or his boss. The company runs each location like a franchise, rather than a part of the company. Meaning each location is provided well under the level of funding/budgeting they need for staffing. It is impossible to meet any company standards or hit revenue/profitability targets, because you never have enough staff or resources to even be somewhat comfortable. Working here was hell. Constantly running around to try and get through the day, only to be told that your efforts will never be good enough. Trust me when I say to avoid this place.

1. To learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible, about Supply Chain as a whole .
2. To gain high level management skills by being thrown into the fire
3. Make it ""to the top"" of the industry, in terms of knowledge, as fast as possible
4. If you consider yourself extremely driven and a hard worker
5. Consider yourself ""hard to rattle"" and very much an extrovert

Overall this experience is a good way to get a crash course in SCM, as long as you are willing to accept what that is going to take. Get in and get out after a year, or 2 if you can handle it.","These pro's are great, but they are all that DHL explains to you when you are applying and being recruited from College and they came at a cost. The following are some examples:

1. For the first year, you will almost certainly work on a night shift (either 3pm-11pm or 11pm - 7am)
2. You will be getting there at LEAST an hour before your shift and often times staying anywhere from 1 - 4 hours after the shift depending on your site.
3. Hardly anybody makes it past a year from the college recruit program because of these reasons:
 3a. You will be worked harder than anybody you graduated with and most likely make less (Standard right now is $52,500 out of college)
 3b. You will miss out on most of your life that year
 3c. No matter what they say, Management (except for a few diamonds in the rough) do NOT care about you, they are trying to stay afloat. 
 3d. No matter how well you do, the few negative things will be the main daily talking points
 *** 3e. For example, I had 10 guys and girls I started with around the country that I got to know: 8 of them have already left after a year, and the last 2 are desperately trying to find another job.
4. The people that generally succeed here from this role are generally the ""a-hole leaders"" that only care about getting promoted, and they generally do not know what they are doing and push you to make up for it
5. It will probably take you about 4-5 years to make it to an OM position, making ~$70,000, and your first OM role will be a ""disaster site"" or a start up, where you will work more than you ever have before.
6. You will not have even the slightest work life balance
7. Everyone in upper management brags about how much they work and have worked in the past. The first and most common tip I got was to ""never calculate how much I made per hour""

If you think you can handle these things for a year, I'd say absolutely go for it. It's great experience. Some of the Con's are just a part of being the base level of Supply Chain, but some of them could definitely be fixed or worked on. BUT, if you don't think you can handle this, please consider other options. It will make even the hardest and smartest workers second guess their abilities."

Pay is probably marginally better than similar jobs elsewhere (19.5k),"- Chaotic nature of working in logistics
- Too much expected of CSA`s who earn barely above minimum wage
- Management who are just interested in padding stats to make themselves look good, even at the expense of providing a respectable level of customer service
- Drivers (and management) will straight up lie about things (such as going back to re attempt deliveries) to CSA`s which causes more issues and even angrier customers
- No real job prospects as a CSA, If you want to move up and have to deal with the even greater stress of a management position you will need to start off in Ops rather than customer service
- senior management have told CSA`s that they are only expected to be in the position for about 18 months before leaving. This says it all really about how customer services is viewed within the company
- Management cannot be challenged on anything and will shut down employees if they try to question processes etc, quite often this is done in an unprofessional manner that leads exployees to feel that they are not respected
- One of DPD`s core values is supposed to be ""accountability"" yet every level of the company is very quick to wash their hands of a problem and pass it onto the next person
- The very top level of management seem so far removed from what its actually like working in one of their depots that they rarely make changes that benefit employees. As previously mentioned stats are falsified from drivers, shift managers, ops managers, depot managers, regional managers etc all the way up the chain so that everyone looks good. The people who suffer as a result are customers and then customer service agents who spend their days dealing with the fallout of these decisions.
- Poor work life balance, long sometimes unsociable hours in a mentally draining job"

If you are a little late for work they will give your route to someone else, when you start at 4.30am they expect you to be out within an hour but then you have to find a loading bay, if you find a loading bay you have to find your parcels which most of them are in one place but then the others could be anywhere and you end up looking for them for three hours, and when you are in that early they sometimes are still taking parcels off the lorry as it turned up late and they wont tell you before you turn up so your waiting three hours to get your parcels yet again.
When there is high winds you still have to work at the same price. They expect you to deliver your parcels in the time slots given even though the satnav takes you to the wrong place, and as they dont keep you on the same route you cant get used to finding the difficult properties. 
If you cant find a property and bring the parcel back they will send you back out to deliver it even if that mean it's in a different city.
Working weekends is chaos there about 3 management on shop floor who everyone crowds around so your waiting ages to get some help, on the weekends you still have to deliver to businesses which they know are closed, so you could have 30 boxes to one business which is closed so you have to keep climbing over them to get to other parcels which then eats into your time and if you end up late delivering a parcel they wont care, they have no common sense as they expect you to wear safety boots while you walk from your van to your car and the reason they give is that if you get run over it will save you but in reality shoes are not going to save anything when you get run over, if you refuse to wear the boots walking to your car they will punish you. If you cant find a parcel they wont take it off they expect you to find it so while your searching for it for 3 hours they expect you to deliver on time, you can work 12 hour shifts. Sometimes your parcels can weigh 30kg.
They will lie to you, they hire loads of drivers at busy periods give them false hope but when it's a quiet period they will fire them or force them out."

The pay is poor for what you are expected to do, as a senior I only made 45p more than a sales assistant and I was threatened that my pay would be taken off me if I told others what I made. Money was no better if you were a supervisor, they made 20p more than a senior but they were told to be ‘mini managers’ without the benefit of a managers salary. There was little training given, you learnt on the job and taught be people who were already stretched think while management sat upstairs. Progression was kept for those who sucked up to management and not those who were better or more competent at the job. There is no consistency, in Cheshire Debenhams we went through 6 managers in the four years I was there, only two were actually good at their job and genuinely cared for staff. Staff turn over is awful, we lost 8 members of staff in a few months because the could no longer cope with the stress management put on them. Generally a very poor place to work, staff on the floor were left completely demotivated, it was hard to get staff to come in for overtime as they just didn’t want to be in the store."

Some people go years without having raises  or raises so minuscule one wonders if it was a joke .  A lot of them make ends meet by doing copious amounts of overtime. Since DB is the biggest customer of these temp agencies, be prepared for them to drop you should you complain about DB's horrid work environment. Management is clueless at best and malicious at worst. There is this one manager that not only treats the deaf employees badly, but she makes it her mission to go to different departments NOT under her supervision just so she can get her kicks from having people fired. Many employees have complained about her but nothing is done since she's a permanent employee of DB and the people complaining are temps. As for other managers, they promote the laziest and biggest brown-nosers imaginable to lead positions and then wonder why work isn't get done. Instead they blame the grunts who are actually doing the work for the screwups. The volume of work is increasing daily but instead of hiring more, they just expect everybody to work weekends. Unsurprisingly, the turnover is high all around.

Great culture (friendly people, flexible working, great parental leave).

Very creative environment to work and a great place to build your creative excellence.","Leadership
The standard of leadership is quite poor - don't expect a coaching culture.
If you want to be seen as a talented employee, you need to be able to play the political game, build relationships with the right people and agree with whatever they say. A large portion of senior leaders have gotten to where they are because of their ability to play the game, not because they are experts in their field. This is the foundation of why Diageo is so bad at execution of plans. 

Values
Sad to say, the company values are just some words on a website, they are not practiced or enforced. There is a lot of poor behaviour from senior leaders that goes against Diageo's values but goes ignored (bullying, favouritism and neglecting team members).

Global Culture
The Diageo culture I mention in the 'pro list' above, sadly is for the UK only. The business has not succeeded in embedding the UK culture in all markets. If I had to rate the Diageo USA or Africa cultures, it would be a different story."

Equiniti has been fantastic throughout the COVID period. No redundancies or pay cuts as far as I'm aware. 

If you have a good relationship with senior management, you have the opportunity to move between different divisions, try new job roles and progress quickly within the company. 

Equiniti is making an effort to keep staff healthy and motivated with mindfulness and mental health sessions, fitness challenges and started a working from home hub where teams can share recipes, home schooling tips and other information.","Weak business model and a lack of investment in platforms and products has hindered innovation and development. There seems to be an acceptance of legacy IT systems and processes that have impacted both individual and business-level efficiency.

The acquisition of companies over the years appears to have clouded Equiniti's focus and has led to funding being stretched thinly across numerous divisions. 

While many of the senior management team and directors are competent and able, some have been at the company since the start of their careers and have relatively little experience and, or, minimal qualifications compared to peers at comparable organisations. Nice to see people climbing the ranks but worth keeping on top of the market and seeing whether external candidates could bring more to the role."

But my efforts were never considered and they even gave me the lowest rating possible without actually giving me a project. 
The politics here is so bad. There is a constant standoff between managers even within the same company and that impacts you as well. You aren't allowed to help the another team from the same company or be seen talking with other vertical people in the company. This gives you a bad reputation. You will be continuously micro managed as well.
I was assured multiple times that I will get a project. But I still feel, there wasn't enough effort taken to bring projects to offshore. And yeah there is continuous rift between onsite and offshore as to who will get the projects. I am not sure why this petty mindset is there.
Appraisals and compensation aren't fair as well. The process for the appraisal needs to change. But this pretty much is there in every company. So I would advice the compensation be fair on the employees.
There are also a few other things I wish not to talk about but are prominent in the company.

My manager was inexperienced and refused to hear any suggestion that I made. It felt really demoralising and frustrating. I reached out to other managers, friends from previous job who agreed that it was frustrating… but that’s it.
– I agree, this is a horrible situation.
– What can I do about it?
– I don’t know…
– Wait a year, so I can change teams?
– Maybe. That was changed to 18 months though.

All three of the Org, the project and my manager had ""the worst Pulse rating in the history of the company"" at their level, according to people who had been at Facebook longer. No one reached out.

Salary is very low especially for the area and pay reviews are often meagre. 
A lot of time dedicated to talking in a progressive, albeit overly corporate language, with little concrete results so far. 
Company communications are often vacuous and unhelpful.
Helpful and progressive functions and policies are often removed or allowed to expire with no replacement in place. E.g. our non-core benefits and recognition platform both expired and have yet to be replaced.

People are smart and come from various backgrounds. Diverse thinking and cool personalities. There is a strong emphasis on networking, which creates a pervasive ""catch-up over coffee"" culture. I entered post-undergrad, and I like being able to choose between working back-end/service-side and front-end, and learning a little bit of everything, not necessarily stuck to one thing (though my specialty is Java). Team culture varies depending on the leadership of your team. My first team was not too entry-level friendly, but my team did genuinely care about my growth and had my back; I always felt that I was treated with respect. Overall I've had a pretty positive experience with working in a team and working to my own schedule. Since pandemic I've been working remotely, and the plan is to move forward with a mixed approach (2-3 days in office, 2-3 days working remote from home). Engineering teams do seem open and willing for the mixed-work style moving forward as well, which is good. Internal mobility is always an option and people are willing to help you out. Amenities in the New York office, such as the gym and the cafe, are very nice.","If your main concern is money, you might as well look for a job at a tech company. Could definitely be getting paid better elsewhere. Office politics is definitely a thing. If you're interested in stocks/trading, working at a bank will put restrictions on that. My current team is based in EMEA and is definitely more suited for developing new engineers, but dealing with time difference, keeping in the loop, and making space for myself in project tasks (from the perspective of being based in Americas) has proven frustrating at times."

You can WFH","They expect you to work additional hours with no overtime rate and then they decide when you can take the time back. They are currently going through a restructure and the current management team decided to split everyone into different teams just for the sake of it. The senior managers lack any interpersonal skills and are extremely fake. CAST Belfast is calculated with regards to promotion opportunities and this is pre judged, people in the management team have all worked together previously in different companies this is not coincidental as it's happened a few times.. in short you are expected to do accounting work and get minimum wage.
 There are lots of tasks and if you cant complete a complex one you will be performance managed, even of you can do all the other tasks, example -i cant complete a really difficult task but I'm great at al others, I will be performance managed, if im in a team that does a simple task my role is safe. The senior management team have no idea what they are doing, in particular the director who reads what he is told to read and is so disingenuous. I know my colleagues feel the same way and you will start to see good people leaving due to the uncertainty. Bonus is a disgrace,
you would be better off working in McDonalds! They are making it up as they go along. Avoid CAST at all costs, this part of Grant Thornton is not what it seems. People in the wrong jobs.this is my personal opinion and I hope they fix it! Watch how many people leave now!"

Ok pay but could be more.,"Was given over time even though I didn’t ask for it. My contract was meant to be 20 hrs but the new manager kept regularly assigning me at least 38 hours per week. Her excuse was that it’s because I was working hard so she thought I’d want more hours. I was a student ofc I couldn’t take more hours. Next was that she’d guilt us into staying for longer. E.g my shift ended at 7pm on Fridays and I’d finish my last task but everytime on my way to the staff room she’d say stuff like omgg you can’t leave look at the busy tills even though my colleagues whom I paged in advance were already there to take my place. She’d also try to make me help her by saying it’s just one last thing but add a bunch of things to it at the end. She’d try make it seem like we are all expected to leave the store late and she expected overtime from all of us regardless of our personal situation. If we didn’t she’d say things like how can you leave this to your colleagues, they want to go home too (even though it’s not their time to leave yet), if you stay behind and help they can leave early etc, without taking into account that I had uni in the morning and it was already 1am. Needless to say I didn’t stay long enough to get any offers. But before the new manager came, it was a lovely supportive place. We’d meet our goals and our then manager would help us on the floor if we were too overwhelmed. The new manager would just be on her phone."

Liked the people I worked with.,"Really under appreciated for the efforts you put in.
seeing older managers being treated with disrespect by younger managers.
The managers I had whilst I worked there were really poor as managers go. Id imagine this is because of the poor training you also provide.
Every day there were system issues so nobody could achieve the targets set.
The managers work on a basis of mainly giving bad feedback. To the point a received a customer thank you and only knew about it because of an email gone round instead of a manger saying look you have been doing great look at this etc.
I honestly could continue its awful.
The diversity and inclusion seems to be really low and there is no room for opinion's or personality.
I had a perfect score on a call- as in no feedback and I still wasn't permanent yet because Hastings base everything on statistics. They seem to be used as the be all instead of an indicator, which is what they are.
I decided to write the review because I still haven't received my P45 after leaving Hastings for well over a month now.
Additionally, you have been promoting how great you progression is recently and I think this again is if the face fits the mold because you can't have a person.
lastly, recently the management team at Hastings introduced the below 10% style of management were they have convos with people who are below the 10% bracket, which is encouraging bad behavior towards customers to meet their stats. 
I left because I find this the most demotivating and depressing place of work both in and out of the pandemic."

- Getting abuse when renewal prices are higher than last year. (I could only agree in my head that the price increase was unreasonable and I fully understood customers frustration)
- Seems like a company with a high employee turnover rate to little care is actually given in supporting each person.
- I feel for people with mental health issues as this place will not help one bit. Or even acknowledge it

The training process was great, Dan young gave me a advert for the great place this will be to work ( i was wrong) Once you're out of the training process another thing which was good was the academy period which lasted around 3 weeks with Dharon Pitt this was also a good advert. Unfortunately this was where it ended and the emotional destruction and, blackmail and micro management started. 

If a phone call comes in and they're not going to renew because they've sold there car so, don't require the insurance, this is your fault, WHY DIDN'T YOU RENEW THEM!! If someone rings through and they've told you twice they don't want to renew, make sure you badger them and harass them and stress the customer out because that's what you're told to do. or when a customer comes through and would like to speak to a manager, good luck trying to find one who can justify why they're paid more and actually take the call over from you, you will be told to say this and say that when really the customer would like to speak to the manager, either way it's your fault for even bothering the manager whilst they have a good catch up about social lives etc. 

When you have your 15 minuet break times don't you dare go 30 seconds over it because this will result in a good talking too and making you feel as though you are a child in school. i understand and appreciate someone being late but this is a new meaning. One thing that is great is the bribery, often when the managers or senior members of the staff need a good review in order to keep there job, they'll bribe you, what with? a Kit-Cat was mine, i was so excited i couldn't wait to write about how awesome the culture and workplace was here! if you renew 15 customers in a row without using any time to breath while standing on your head you earn yourself... a TV? Money? a car? no a celebration (not the box a single celebration) 

If you have any sort of mental health, anxiety, or any emotional imbalance avoid working here as a CR. this will finish you off. They often try to promote there 4C's message which is Colleagues, Customers, Company, Community. a great message which starts with colleagues meaning it will benefit the next part and so on, its a shame they done actually do this, if you're feeling down, get back on the phone, late for work due to a car crash, get back on the phone, if your whole family is in a life threatening situation, please please just get back on the phone. if you're feeling down, depressed, suicidal and would love to go home due to you not being able to reach your maximum potential...then please go you need it ( but just expect your disciplinary on your desk tomorrow) but please go if that's what you wanna do. 

i was often asked to stay past contracted hours in order to get through the call ques, despite this not being in my contract it was expected otherwise you should say goodbye to your job. You're also bombarded with awful stat expectations, and when you've had a good day? could do better, when you've had a perfect 100% day there is very little recognition or acknowledgment for this, I'm sure a lot of people who are under this pressure want a 100% day just so they don't have to hear the same broken record about how this is all because of you, you're not doing enough you're not saying what we told you, you didn't do this you didn't do that, be prepared to speak like a robot, but please add some character and personality in there (whilst you repeat exactly what we've said and follow a script) 

There is so many things wrong here, at first i felt i could've been harsh but no this is exactly how its run, it's a schoolground mentality with the managers thinking they're the teachers and own you but life changing consequences, which is loosing your job, I'm sorry to anyone who didn't see this and now works there and to anyone who's reading this and doesn't work here..Don't."

The interview process was like the xfactor but was relatively ok. When I started we were told how lucky we were to have secured a place at Hays and that many other consultants across the country would dream to be in our position. Thought that was a little odd and this really was what most employees at the office believed, that they were inferior to others in the industry. We were set unrealistic and unachievable targets which we had to present the outcome off to the rest of the new starters, HR and the MD. As an experienced consultant I put a lot of pressure on myself to achieve these however when I didn’t and was faced with telling the MD, HR and the other new starters it really dented my confidence as failing to hit KPIs wasn’t something I was used to. However during the presentation it very quickly became clear that none of the other 10 new starters had hit their targets either and after speaking with other colleagues I found out that most people didn’t even come close to hitting their targets either when they started. It seems a strange process to put new starters through and certainly caused a lot of us undue stress. I do wonder why Hays haven’t looked at this and changed it as it was clear the targets were unachievable which was proved by not one person hitting them. I guess this would be a fair reflection of how the company is run, out of date and corporate. There was little training on the industry of your desk, I wasn’t trained on payroll despite having 5 people out working for me and the CRM system is hard to use, slow and isn’t fit for purpose.

-you can also leave early if something came up and need to go somewhere different city or anything else and use it as flexi and work it back, so overall with flexi time you can pretty much decided which days you want to take off , no pressure whatsoever , you can also take 9 days to the next annual working year carry on.
-Also you can can carry upto 3 days of flexi leave days to the next month, so you work more hours during the current month and build up so you can have 3 extra days off next month
-for example, a friend of mine used all their annual leave during the year, then his friends wanted to go a week holiday, but i he had 2 annual leave days left, so he worked extra during the month and 3 days off extra next month during the holiday, the line manager has to agree with it but all managers agree.
-you can start anytime between 6:30am and 10am, its 7 hours 24 minutes a day work, but people normally work 7:30 mins a day and 30 mins break so 8 hours a day monday to thursday, then friday leave 30 mins early.
-the latest you work till is 7pm, unless the line manager agrees for you to work more to certain circumstances.
-you can have small breaks during you work time quick 5-10 mins, i normally go our for fresh air, alot of people go out to smoke regularly, it doesnt count part of your break. minimum break time is 30 mins but you can have an hour you just work 30 mins extra, if you want more you can for example 1 hour 30 mins or 2 hours just speak to manager they will let you, you just have to work it back.

“Guest satisfaction is not a priority, the management is only focused on numbers therefore the team is constantly working under pressure.

 If you are not liked by someone within the management team, you are taken to this small office everyday and told off, until you give up and resign.” It is also true that only poor skilled people are getting promoted and their only skill is to “report” and being the bad cop of the situation. Management is really bad and Front Office managers do not want to work on Weekends, which gives a horrible example and also do not care about your wellbeing.

- Lack of junior support on most teams. You'll have director-level and lead-level employees stretched thin because they're still doing the same responsibilities even after they're promoted
- Some department execs are lifers (20+ years) which is good and bad. They know the inner machinations, but also tend to be less risk averse or have limited understanding of how marketing happens outside our company

On my action of challenging some of them, authority and the fact that I don’t have the required understanding of such matters has been invoked to me.
My general feeling on working at Knight Frank can be reduced to some of my experience in dealing with rental property agents, where the main goal was to make easy money by all means. If I can accept this in the rental business, I find it outrageous to see it applied in a technical environment by the upper management.
In short, if you don’t like to be asked to put a smile on your face when the manager wants it, if you don’t want to be hearing lies which may affect your development path, if you don’t want to be putting a lot of effort in delivering projects which are meant to be tick box exercises for your manager and if you want to be yourself and respected for being so, then Knight Frank is not the company you are looking for. On the other hand, if you have no problem with being a yes man, if you care more about money than you care about the working environment, if you don’t have a strong technical background and no plans of improving it and if you don’t worry too much if the management layer uses your work to collect credits without recognizing your effort, then Knight Frank might be a good fit for you.
The human resources are just a bad joke. How else could they be in such an environment? It is ruled by the well-known principles of defending the management layer and making sure that they say how much care is put in the so-called company culture, but, based on my experience with them, it shows as an extreme version of such approach.
So, in my understanding, Knight Frank is toxic working environment which should be avoided as much as possible."

You must purchase one pair of new shoes every time the season changes, which means they can't be on sale or an old design. It's 75% discount on one pair of full-price shoes, and when new season shoes average around £120-150 you're still paying a lot for your uniform, when you earn such a pittance to begin with. Women must wear makeup, have preened nails, and nicely-styled hair, and heels are very much pressured and preferred - is this the 1950s? Uniforms within department store concessions have to be one of two styles of dresses (and you only get one actual dress, even if you work full time hours on a 9 hr contract!). Male employees can pretty much look however they want. You are expected to come in 15 minutes early every shift, but you are not paid for it, and you are given a formal warning if you do not. This daily 15 minutes adds up to literally days of free labour. I earned £2.50 an hour plus commission. I had to ask what happens if it's a quiet day, and their answer was ""Don't worry, the system works it out so that you never get less than minimum wage."" I never saw this in action, and of course I wasn't given access to records of all of my sales across each month, so I was never sure that this was actually true. The system to allocate commission is questionable: if the store is being shut by junior members of staff, they are responsible for entering everyone's sales into the system, and they could easily enter some in on their own name and never be caught out. It should always be entered by a neutral party (i.e. manager) who doesn't get commission. The behaviour of one manager was abusive, bullying and absolutely toxic, but she was moved to a different branch. Nothing was done and I believe she is still working there. The employees are not empowered to come forward to report bullying."

It’ll be nice to be in, but 0-60 will take 20 years.

Big org, diverse environments to work in. Wonderful people and changeable pace, lots of best practice to learn from. It’s highly regulated, so you see what good looks like every day.

I enjoyed all the teams I worked with. Loved the different divisions and completely different operating models. I worked in many locations. Kingswood, Cardiff, Brighton, London and even regional partners.

I started as a Senior Finance Analyst and progressed to management fairly fast in 2 years. Being a business partner to multiple divisions across a few entities has given me some great insights into operating models, having some challenging projects to work on commercially and financially.

It’s hard to make a difference there; to have a voice and face. I managed to, but had to slog and really push change to sell it more widely. Shouldn’t be so hard to make things better.","In finance it’s hard to get up the chain into senior leadership there and regardless of skills, shining reviews, outstanding performance etc, restructures set people back year in year out, which is pretty awful; there’s a lot of competition from Group finance who are markedly more visible to leadership, so opportunities there is fairly static and staid. You just have to see how long people stay “finance managers” before becoming heads. Some 10 years, (reshuffled, relearn, reestablish, outperform, only to be displaced due to restructure to start all over again). When that happens to the superstars, you know there are issues. 

It’s poorly paid as well. For a FTSE it’s shocking. It’s not until you leave that you realise how bad the pay grades are. Pigeonholed in Finance, in middle management, during the most important time of your career to diversify and grow.

I left, took a seniority cut in different sector, (a charity at that) earning £10,000k more + 20% bonus, was promoted in new role within 6 months. Within a year promoted again as a head in FP&A and Business Improvements. So after pouring heart and soul into that company, to earn peanuts for 7 years at L&G as a high performing Finance Manager, within 4 years of leaving, 2 companies later, I’m now an Operations Director, with loads more experience and on track for a fulfilling career doing what I do best.

I interviewed at legal and general a couple years back in Hove. Unsurprisingly it seemed the world had stopped going back there. Even the tech and ways of working were the same. (Which filled me with dread given how much the world had advanced with MS Teams/interview techniques/tablets etc) I realised it’s a leviathan and will take tens of years to change process and senior leadership. It’s stifling. Systems are still same, ways of working are backward and unsurprisingly, I found myself questioning why I’d want to work there again after tasting what “excellent” looks and feels like.

Quite stark. That industry really grabs a person and pins them in place.

Training opportunities and courses are archaic too."

And we focus on making it easier, better & more accessible to our customers in every way that we can. Everyone really cares here.

Plus L&G also invests in really entrepreneurial & ethical new areas like Affordable Homes & our underpinning Inclusive Capitalism overarching purpose that allows us to invest in the evolution of our cities and our environmentally friendly future.

It's a big company that can do incredible amounts of good, but it also feels small, authentic & manageable. It has a wide variety of roles, from customer facing, regulator facing, through to digital, engineering, actuarial roles, customer service & financial services SMEs. Our Digital Teams here have grown exponentially over the years and will only continue to get bigger and better.

Women and men excel alike. There are many women in top roles & it's never felt unbalanced here at L&G. Indeed annual reviews of pay scales take place unprompted to ensure equality continues to be a top priority. Location-wise we're dotted across many lovely places across the UK too, so it provides variety in where you can base yourself.","We are a company on a big journey with a strong mission but it can, like in all large organisations, take a while to get there. We're not as nimble as the start-ups and do have the expected amount of legacy tech behind us, but that's because we're a company that's been doing business for a long time. That said, there are many plans in place to allow us to both catch up & move ahead - we all play our role in creating that future."

We were told we get a £1 a year pay rise and we are currently getting 40p a year which is now capped after 3 years at £10.50 (new starters reach £10.50 in a year now). We were told we get lots of benefits like cheaper contracts with EE and cinema tickets which was a lie.

The place is also run by senior managers who want nothing to do with warehouse staff and care only about productivity and not staff health or wellbeing. Below them are the ATMs who are so stressed due to senior management that they often take it out on warehouse staff and charge hands. The charge hands (which no longer even get £1 extra an hour) are dropping like flies and stepping down so quickly that they are forced to continue to do the charge hand role and are on the verge of mental break downs until they can convince some gullible sap to replace them and be a whipping boy for managers for no extra pay.

HR and recruitment are always scratching their heads and asking how they can improve the absolutely shocking staff turnover they have but don't seem to notice that the warehouse management seem to like the staff turnover as it is easier to convince new starters to work stupidly quick to achieve non existent progression. 

Injured at work and not your fault? Better hope you have sick days left because they aren't going to pay you and you'll need to get a union or solicitor involved to put in a claim to recoup lost wages. Also they have a tendency to lie to the council to make any accident seem like your fault to avoid guilt and then make you chase your own tail for cctv footage.

The rota patterns are terrible and always have been. Old pattern involved us working 7 days in a row sometimes with only one day off. Now we have working weeks of 5 days in, 1 day off, 4 days in, 1 day off f then another 5 days in. It kills you! And they still expect you to maintain a high performance target! 

Performing well or quickly means nothing to these people. You work harder they raise your targets. Meet those targets and they raise them again and will keep raising them until you can't achieve their targets then they will threaten you with disciplinary actions to push you to kill yourself attempting to hit their target or it pushes you to leave. You also won't get anywhere in the company by working harder as it seems to be if your face fits and not performance. Slow lazy people get easier jobs so they don't hurt their performance figures and certain people regardless of performance barely have to do any work. 

If you want to work here be prepared to be transported back to your schools days of being told of by your headmaster as that's how they treat you. Like a child."

It's impossible to meet the speed standards without breaking food and working safety rules. The chill chain is 20 minutes. So a chiller pallet needs to be worked in 20 minutes. This takes two employees, and both need to be fast. Usually, its not possible to arrange two fast employees on chiller every time. Usually it was me alone. Sometimes it was me and a slow employee. Only rarely did we have two fast workers on chiller. So the chill chain simply had to be broken most of the time chiller pallets were worked.

You are bombarded with work as soon as you start the job, not given any chance to learn the ropes. 

I read all the bad reviews before accepting the job and put it down to people only writing a review if they’ve had a bad experience. Now I know the reviews were a true reflection of what it’s like here. I’ve spoken to people who have worked here a long time and nobody has a good word to say.

They also promise they’re going to put you through the IOC course and give you a pay rise when you complete it. It’s a scam, nobody has this qualification here. I think they just put it in the adverts to make you think the job might have prospects.

There is a culture of incompetence at the company. Other colleagues when asked for help, either ignore you or are unhelpful. I honestly think it’s because nobody is very good at the job due to lack of training.

Workloads are crazy as every department appears to be understaffed. Instead of getting more people in, they’ll just keep allocating you work that they know you won’t even be able to do for a month because your workload is so high."

Since being there I had noticed that although the motto is diversity and inclusion, for the most part if you had different opinions from the people that had been there a while they would not accept you into their group and would actively seek to try and get people fired.
The management leaves a lot to be desired as they too seem to have their favourites and would rather give into office politics and gossip leaving aside the quality of work.
I have yet to find a place where you could feel less job security than here fearing what someone may say behind your back with your job on the line, with all the immaturity of a primary school.
The job left me with severe anxiety and depression which is a shame as I had high hopes for such a reputable company. Alas this is just another call center job with a call center mentality with almost everyone having their moments of power tripping from the floor walkers to the so called specialists and team leaders.
A word of advice for anyone stepping foot into this establishment ... Don't! But if you must, just keep your head down and be the robot they want you to be."

It's a decent place to start after graduation. Base pay can be pretty low, especially if you're not on the actuarial track and are a strategy consultant. However, pay is hourly and you are compensated for the long overtime you have to work, evening out pay to a decent living wage (pre-pandemic, during COVID OT was cut for all junior employees, yet middle management and senior leadership saw no pay cuts, pushing analysts to not be able to afford to live in NYC and not get compensated for work they did, but I digress)

People are friendly, and it's a great learning opportunity. If you are lucky to get put under the right teams and people, your responsibilities can grow very quickly and you can get exposed to a lot.","The pay discrepancy between consultants on the actuarial track vs strategy is absurd, especially at the lower levels where the difference in responsibilities is actually minimal. Actuarial consultants also have near unlimited budgets for employee development for their tests, while generalists do not have the same opportunities to earn even relevant certifications on the company's dime. This is why attrition is so high on the general strategy consultants side.

Also, with the exception of very senior principal/partner levels, promotions are based almost exclusively on tenure rather than performance, alienating higher performers when consistently low performers get promoted along with them.

Also for a health benefits brokerage firm, the benefits packages are ironically pretty terrible."

Good pension scheme","The culture is really not what it used to be.
Since the new management took over, it has all gone downhill.
Extremely long hours, no work life balance, senior managers and directors email and message at all hours (earliest I got was 5am and latest midnight), even though they claim that ‘they are happy to discuss flexible working’. Flexible meaning, you have to be flexible and around.
Career progression is based on favouritism, or knowing that if they don’t promote, people will definitely leave, and people agreeing to get promotions without a raise with a semi-promise that they will get something the next year. Don’t ask for a raise, you won’t get it and you will end up 
 in their bad books.
The pay is low, the benefits are not great, except for the pension which is pretty good.
Don’t expect bonuses to be of much worth, and they stress that they are discretionary.
They don’t actually care about well-being, people being overworked and underpaid. It’s extremely difficult to get in lieu time for the extra time worked even if your manager knows that you have worked 10-12 hour days.
If you do decide to join, treat this as a temporary gig, most people leave after a couple of years, primarily the ones who are good at their jobs. The rest get promoted to fill roles that are incapable of doing.
Also, forget about training, there is literally no budget for that. They have an internal team who (bless them) do the best they can, but clearly are not going to be able to offer specialised training in areas outside the core bank roles.
Don’t make the same mistake I made to buy into the ‘culture’, it’s at best a facade. Who is left is some senior directors who have no clue what they are doing and destroying anything good left from the culture."
Metro-Bank,2021-03-26, Human Resources,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","London, England, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,x,x,x,Worst place I’ve ever worked,Non management colleagues are a credit to the company. Promised so much and rarely receive anything. I feel so sorry for what they have been told in terms of progression and development as this is just a myth and they only find out a few weeks into their role. “Your promotion path is endless” colleagues get told.,"- Never have I worked in a company where money is just thrown at the most irrelevant causes. It is shocking to think how much money Metro have thrown away that shareholders are unaware of
- Promotions only occur if you have the gift of the gab in terms of sucking up. Forget being rewarded for hard work and initiative - you will only be promoted if you agree with management and never ever challenge the norm. Metro prides itself on apparently listening to everyone - trust me this does not happen. You could flag risks until you are blue in the face but nothing will happen
- HR department have made up promotions that they give to their staff to give them higher titles. These roles are never advertised or earnt, they are simply given so when these colleagues leave Metro they stand a better chance of obtaining a higher position outside of the bank. I feel sorry for other companies that hire anyone from Metro as they will think they are doing say a Head of role when the functions they are doing don't even warrant that of a manager. Someone had 4 promotions in 1 year to become a director - think that says it all.
- There are meetings galore without anything ever coming from it. All people do at Metro bank is talk without ever completing anything. All political spin jargon to make everything sound professional but in reality it is shocking how unprofessional the company is.
- You will not believe how many made up titles Metro have which means there are about 10 people doing the same job as you and you end up constantly challenging other people as to why they are doing what you should be doing."

Colleagues at the lower level are mostly amazing 

Some customers are brilliant to serve","Social responsibility is non existent when it comes to ethnic minorities. The company’s leadership team at every turn, challenge and opportunity have a shocking appetitive to getting things wrong or just being complicit. 

If fully reflects Britain as it is in the sense that it is the least meritocratic company I’ve ever worked for but it continues to spit out garbage about opportunities. This is evident especially at the higher levels so from level 3 and above, I mean I personally know regional managers vacancies that where advertised but filled after the director personally rang someone to offer them a job without even going through the interview process (nepotism) 

Crabs in the barrel mentality is encouraged immensely by deliberately putting people against each other and not in a healthy competitive manner but almost for sport 

Leadership team aren’t leaders, they are simply managers who micro manage at every stage. They don’t inspire or lead. They don’t trust their colleagues or employees to deliver even though they are the ones that will deliver kpis and objectives.

Lastly, as a leader myself i would sacrifice my interests for the benefit of my team. In Morrison’s almost every leader from store manager level upwards would and in cases were I’ve personally experience sacrifice their colleagues for their own interest and gains"

You receive three discount cards when you start.

I made a few really great friends","Ironically HR were NOT people persons. Many of us were extremely intimidated by them. One minute they were happy and the next unhappy. Very unapproachable.

The work culture was toxic. Team leaders in the home delivery department just gossiped about the managers, how lazy the other team leaders were and gossiped about the pickers too. They dont understand confidentiality, hence private matters are known all around the store due to the gossipy work culture. 

A common theme was how they hated the job and were all looking to move on. They arrive on shift in a foul mood, and vocally state they don't care about the department and are looking for other jobs. Blame pickers for everything that goes wrong, even when they are the ones 'leading' us. Great for morale.

Terrible team leaders who were promoted for no other reason than the other leaders quit. They're given greater responsibility without any training, they don't know what leading is and love to micromanage. Many of them lack people skills and lack organisation. Hence the reason they demote themselves to picker because the role doesn't suit them, then ask to be a leader again because they want the pay. Made pickers do their jobs then wonder why the pickers fall behind.

They tell you off for talking even if it's about work, then you go into the warehouse and theyre having a gossip about their dating lives/clubbing. 

You tell the manager your availability and then they go on to ignore it. Always got phone calls telling me to come into work on my days off, then told it was an expectation.

The communication was NONEXISTENT. Store manager told me the manager meetings happen on the shop floor. Lol. It felt like most days I turned up on shift, I would get told off for something that was perceived fine the week before... This was because all procedures, rule changes and messages, were communicated in passing. Rather than by company emails.

Northern-Gas-and-Power,2020-12-10, Call Centre Operator,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Leeds, England, England",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,x,x,x,Get out now whilst you still can!!,Absolutely none whatsoever! If i could give 0 stars i would.,"Firstly, let me start off by saying if you have just started at Northern Gas and Power Run! Get out now whilst you still can! This job will suck your soul and drain any life and enthusiasm you had to begin with, leaving you an empty shell of a human being and a shadow of your former self.

Let’s drop a few truth bombs, in training you are sold the dream. They spend a whole day telling you how much money you are going to make and whatever your hopes and dreams are, write them down because you will achieve them all whilst working here with the cringe worthy phrase ""one call can change your life"" this saying is designed to give you hope, but you will quickly learn that you've got more chance of finding a well in the Sahara Desert and any hope you do have in this job will be ended quicker than Usain Bolt running the 100m.

The reality is you are working in a bottom of the barrel call centre making between 150-200 calls a day to businesses that have been called by NGP every day, sometimes up to 6 times a day! I have literally had people pick up the phone and say ""Hello Northern, Gas and Power"" before I’ve even said a word! Hammered is an understatement. These people don't want to speak to you and you have to ring them to achieve the minimum 3hrs talk time per day. Bearing in mind the average time on one call is about 1 minute you can see how your day pans out! I can’t tell you how many times management repeat the saying ""3 hours or sale!"" yep I think I got that, you tell me that about 12 times a day! Towards the end of the day you are just doing call time for call time’s sake anyway.

In regards to making loads of money, you will start off as a lead generator and any ""deal"" you get has to be split with a closer 50/50. In order to pass your probation and start earning commission you need to make £30,000 for the company in 3 months. Now bearing in mind you have to split any sale you get with your closer, therefore you have to make £60,000 in 3 months in order to pass probation. Do you know how much commission you will make if you achieve this target in 3 months? Based on the commission structure you will receive £300!! That's right £300. So I make the company £60,000 and the reward I get is £300? I've seen better prizes at Gala Bingo on a Wednesday. 

They say closers will close 70% of the ""deals"" you give them, in my experience its more around the region of 15%. They are only ever interested in their own deals and will get around to yours if they can be bothered. You have to constantly ask them what's happening with your ""deals"" and most of the time they don't even know what ""deal"" you’re talking about! I have referred to ""deals"" in this review in inverted commas this is because NEVER get excited by a ""deal"", they will never get closed and if they do, a couple of days later you can bet that they will fall into objection. How are you supposed to put money on your board if your closers are incompetent?

Don't even get me started on the ticket system! Once you have bills and an LOA you need to submit a ticket so that you can obtain the information you need. I am convinced the ticket system is like a black hole. You send the information into the hole and it just disappears and no-one really knows where it ends up! I submitted a few tickets and no word of a lie just over 1 month later they replied ""do you still need this?"" It’s been a month! what do you think?! The people that work there are utterly useless and I really don't know what they do all day! 

The people in the ""office"" (call centre) you work in, truly believe their job is like 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. They come in dressed in 3 piece suits to sit on the phones all day! They start the day with this pointless and embarrassing desk bang where for 2mins you just bang your desk continuously. It’s supposed to get you all revved up for the day but in actual fact it leaves you cringing and makes your hands hurt! You are also told constantly to stand up whilst make calls to get some atmosphere in the place, but trying to create atmosphere in there is like trying to relight a burnt match!

On the topic of being pointless, there are 4 meetings a day and each meeting, they say exactly the same thing word for word! They would be better off just recording one meeting and playing it after each break on a tape recorder - it’s that repetitive! 

The whole ""office"" is kept in sub-zero temperatures it should actually be considered a slow form of torture, even eskimos would struggle! their reasoning behind the temperature is that ""It keeps you alert"" but it’s hard to be alert when I can’t feel my fingers and toes and my heart rate has dropped to an alarmingly slow rate!

To conclude, this is the WORST job I have ever had in my entire life, there have been several occasions when I have gone to the toilet and looked for suitable places to end it all. The people are terrible, the money is terrible, the ""office"" is terrible the company and the job are both terrible. Don’t do it to yourselves!! trust me you will be much better off. This was a painful harrowing experience and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy! I can’t tell you the happiness that washes over me knowing that I never have to set foot in that place again. I still get PTSD from trigger words such as ""3 hours"" or ""energy"" but I can confidently say I am on the road to recovery and am thinking about starting a support group for those affected by Northern Gas and Power. What a terrible company to work for Sayonara suckers good luck hitting call time!

(Oh and if you’re wondering why this company has so many positive reviews, it’s because we are paid £10 to leave a positive review. When I was working there I did it because let’s face it a tenner is a tenner but don’t be fooled!)"

I inherited a codebase in much need of some TLC but was given the opportunity to fix and rewrite where needed. I was very fortunate that I had a development manager who understood the importance of reducing tech debt. The office politics was at a minimum, my team was free to chose the right tech for the right job and we had the ability to explore new solutions and innovate where necessary. I actually felt like a tech lead rather than a dev with the title of tech lead who is bound by restrictive processes as I have experienced at other places.
Many opportunities for learning and development.
Some great tech challenges and I had a very supportive development manager.
Flexible working
No core hours
Flexi days
25 - 30 days holiday
Low stress environment.","I was lucky that I had a great product and a great team so I dont have any war stories but there is a major drawback to ONS:

As a developer; joining ONS is like playing Russian roulette with your career. You could be lucky (like I was) and get to use the latest cloud tech and explore new development practices as you see fit and work with forward thinking development/project managers. The other side to ONS is the old legacy side where you'll be stuck maintaining code that was written in languages that went unsupported more than 2 decades ago - imagine working on a codebase that was considered legacy before you were even born. Imagine a codebase so hopelessly broken and bloated that its almost impossible to refactor without simply burning the whole thing and starting again. Now imagine never being given the opportunity to improve that codebase or even being given the opportunity to move to another team. That's what awaits you if you get stuck with legacy. Career suicide.

I was fortunate that I never got stuck with legacy, my rating of ONS would be far lower if that was the case.

For any developer who is offered a position here, please check before you accept the offer - the team you will be working on, the product, tech and type of work you will be doing. Some of the developer positions are more like 1st line support. Don't fall for the line, ""We have some old tech but we're hoping to upgrade soon"". Remember, no upgrades after 20 years of legacy, you have to assume that their legacy system will still be there festering and ruining careers for another 20 years."

Nobody ever says anything nasty to you, no matter what they think of you
Super positivity, if you like that kind of thing","It's a work cult.
Everyone at the company appears to believe they are doing amazing work.
Nobody at the company is doing the work required to do amazing work. There is never any analysis of failures or even admission of failures. There is never even any attempt to improve as there is never an admission of room to improve.
Everything is done at breakneck pace. Quality is sacrificed everywhere, but polish is never to be sacrificed.
You are sometimes asked for estimates, but in the vaguest possible terms. This estimate will come back to bite you, although you might not recognise it as your original estimate.
You are culturally forbidden from ever providing any negative feedback (like 'this can't be done in this time'). You must suck it all up yourself and work crazy hours to get stuff out the door. If you do not do this you will wonder why you are always getting rolled off projects and nothing you say matters -- negative feedback doesn't come your way either so you can never talk to anyone about why something didn't work (it's always assumed it's your fault) so nothing ever gets better.
If you do want to find out what really happened on a project you have to find someone willing to talk behind closed doors-- it's absolutely never done to talk openly about failure, everything is always an amazing breakthrough success.
If you want to survive at this company, learn to surf the very top of the Dunning-Kruger curve, because that's where you'll be the whole time.
And kiss goodbye to everything you do outside of work."

I swear I am not kidding at all !! The ""chosen"" one will stay the same till he left. Nobody knows the reason and manager insisted this was right in his opinion. I saw one guy worked very hard every day that he even had no time for lunch while his peers are pretty free, then in Nov he was told that there was no budget of salary raise. There is no way to object except leave . 
3. The chair is very bad, because of back-ache many employees bought replacement on their own but company prohibit that."

Not to mention, the Higher ups only care about speed and numbers. They don't care about you at all. Especially now during the pandemic. If they finally decide to close down a store near you for 2 weeks because of positive cases within that store, all the orders, including delivery, get sent to your store.

The Service Users were occasionally challenging but usually great fun to be around. 

Most of the staff I worked with are lovely, caring and diligent people, and I hope to stay in contact with several of them. 

The grounds were (once upon a time) beautiful.","Management - the attitude of some individuals stinks (others were very supportive). 

Communications are abysmal - top-down, one-way and inefficient beyond nightmare status. Newsletters, clearly designed for online distribution, are printed out and circulated behind a signing sheet. None of the houses had computers or printers, so everything was done on paper, and if you ran out of any forms on the weekend you spent more time trying to scrounge forms from other houses than filling the damn things in. When they eventually find their way 'upstairs' they are typed in to a computer and then apparently forgotten about.

Investment is awful. The fabric of the building and grounds were very poorly maintained - there were innumerable safety issues that we had to live with, such as broken lighting, doors hanging off of hinges, damaged door locks and self-closers, and constant issues with laundry and cooking equipment. The grounds have been let go to wrack and ruin.

The food prepared for the service users is sometimes embarrassing. Crappy ingredients coupled with weird menus and bizarre recipes put together by people whose skill level ran from 'chef' standard to worse than '1st-year-at-Uni'. The site deals with eating disorders but I never met anyone with any form of qualification as a nutritionist or dietician.

Career and professional development is treated as a burden. If you find a course to expand upon a special interest don't even waste your time applying for support or funding.

The worst thing is that the site manager at my location couldn't be bothered to talk to staff. When she does she is often rude. When she visits the service users she is often rude to them and nearly always provokes some kind of incident for the Support Workers to manage after she's gone. And she seems totally oblivious to her purpose (to care for her service users) and her biggest business issue (attracting and retaining staff).

Like so many other places in care, Trust, Loyalty and Flexibility are one-way streets."

-Flexible around commitments as many services operate 24/7.

-The work is challenging due to complex needs service users but at least each day is different. The friendly teams of staff you work with day in day out will make learning the job and also the long days easier. 

-They have one of the most extensive career development pathways in the industry if you are willing to pursue it.","-As with the wider privatised healthcare/adult care industry employee benefit/conditions have been reduced to the legal minimum.
No sick pay other than SSP, no rising with years of service annual leave, no hourly enhancements for Nightshift, weekends. or overtime. Some services give temporary uplifts for example £1 an hour in times of desperate need but this is rare. In the organisations defence it should be noted the reduced benefits is an industry wide problem directly resulting from post 2010 government spending cuts to NHS and Local Councils, as this is where most revenue comes from. 

-Linked to the first point, some long standing staff are on older contracts and have sick pay entitlement, rising holiday entitlement, and uplifts for Nightshifts, weekends and overtime. While I would never want them stripped of this It is important to note the effect it has on staff morale among the growing proportion of newer staff who do not have these benefits.

It seems a lot of the senior management have no empathy at all and treat the nursing team like annoying, demanding pests when all we really ask for is a bit of support, understanding and a higher number of staff on the wards so that we and the patients are not at risk of being injured. The wards are not safe because there are not enough staff to look after the patients that have such a high risk.

It makes coming to work every day so much more enjoyable when you feel part of a great organisation and your work and your opinions are valued. It's a big family and everyone looks out for each other.

I work in sales - the bonus scheme is the best I've come across and even during the pandemic the business has found a way to reward and incentivize us through this really tough period in and out of lockdown

Outside of money, there are always extra awards, prizes, competitions and small gestures that personally make a big difference. 

We get an opportunity to give feedback every month and tell the Senior Leadership Team what we like and what we'd like to see improved. 

I hope to be at reed for many years to come.","From a sales point of view - it's a really tough market and it's becoming more crowded. I'd like to see more collaboration between Sales and Marketing so we can really drive improvement in site performance together. Hopefully it's something we can really focus on as we come out of the other side of this pandemic.

They do not do a good job of training (unless you’re audit or tax) and expect perfection. They only focus on the negatives and no matter how many positives there are, the negatives will always outweigh them. I was micromanaged by my career advisor, who wasn’t even technically my manager but was very degrading towards me. They do not have a good work-life balance either, the team expects you to be there by 8:30 and won’t let you leave until the partner leaves.

- Mostly friendly people however theyre still very predjudice.
- You get to organise your own day.
- Get a company vehicle (might smell of rats)

I would just like to say that a lot of the older folks who'd been there years that I worked with were very happy with rentokil and it was mostly the younger and newer people who weren't very happy with it. The highest staff turnover was for young people too.","There are more cons than pros. 
There's a lot more than this too in more detailed areas. But I'll refrain from saying that here. 

- Grossly underpaid. A lot of other pest control companies do pay more as I had looked for other companies before deciding I never wanted to do pest control again.
- Horrendous staff retention meaning you will be constantly over worked and covering for people
- Only pay rise you will get is a potential bonus which you have to hit your KPIs to get. 
- Financial penalties and trackers if you don't hit KPIs
- People whove worked for the company for 20 years were on a salary of around £23k which is £3k more than the new graduate starters. The guy who trained me was only on £3k more than I was and he was IPAF trained, confined space trained, trained to use phosphine gas, could shoot and was a level 4 feild biologist level. 
- Sexist environment. A male dominated work place full of old men over the age of 50-60 who can be sexist and ageist. Its disgusting to work around. Very sexist attitude towards women who have children too and have to take time off work for their children. One of the team leaders was constantly critisized by her team and other staff for looking after her children. Team could be more diverse too. It just seemed a bit much. 
- If you do not feel safe doing something you can't just refuse to do it. They expect you do it even if it isn't safe to do - this pressure doesnt necessarily come from management more from your peers.  You have to learn to stand up and say no a lot to people rather than health and safety being just widely accepted. 
- Any greivances you raise at a team meeting will be brushed off. We had surveys done and over 50% of staff were unhappy. This was brushed off because people had 'filled in the survey and left' even though the survey was pretty recent. Really felt like we weren't listened to and there was no point in offering improvements. 
- expectation that your phone would be on outside of working hours. 
- Trying to write detailed reports on a mobile phone was difficult. You will probably end up with arthritis in your thumbs if you did this job for any length of time. 
- We were provided with tablets but you couldnt write your site reports on them so they were a bit redundant. 
- Mobile phones were often outdated and not fit to the task when a PDA would have been much better. 
- Mobile phones are used to track your movements.
- Problems could be difficult to solve as you would deal with a site manager or other employee rather than the person paying for the pest control meaning that it would take ages for the issue to get solved and there would be little penalty from rentokil if the client did not do as was advised which was very stressful.

This is my opinion from what I have seen and experienced and is anecdotal. As far as Im aware what I witnessed was true. Things may have changed since then. But I would not work for rentokil ever again because of my experience. I was only there a year too. I only did it for the work experience so I could do a job I actually wanted to do."

- We are provided with flexible login options using MyRyan, an excellent policy.","- Leadership should also to be good enough as company to implement the policies. They (not all) are real policy breakers and nurture informal batches. Ensure to give Apple (no policies and one year promotions) to these people only. They even create fake stories and achievements for their people. 
- Few follow Gender priorities and promote to have female coordinator, supervisor and so on. 
- They have to question themselves before asking for flexibility howmuch they are flexible to be with all employees instead of being with a batch. Promotes high biased ness and shows zero fareness. 
- Having a title of SM is not great but ensuring fairness for all levels equally is important. They want to involve in all the things even if team wants to celebrate, party, and forms small fun committee too. 
-Orders to all women to go attend the WIN meetings irrespective of the interest, while female employees from other departments were going as per their interest. Even in female employees also, biased for few. Lot of disown by female employees but they cannot share upfront. 
- Thank God I left these people and worried alot to leave the firm. 
- Our Manager (God knows what he does and just nods head for the boss words. Firm takes actors) is there are to say yes for all the decisions they make. Sad to see powerless Ms, AMs and TL's, who could not take decisions and to depend on. 
- Has to understand how all the employees lives are tied with their early corporate life and give that minimum value to all equally.

If you aren't familiar with what it is, myRyan is a system that allows you to work from home (even pre-pandemic) whenever you would like.","My experience at Ryan began with no training whatsoever. At first, I was fine with this because I felt prepared to do my job. But, my manager wanted things done in a particular way but would never communicate this forthrightly. Additionally, my manager was very absent and would only check in with me every few weeks or so. At first, this independence seemed like a good thing, since I am organized and kept track of all upcoming deadlines, etc. on my own. However, what I came to realize only too late is that my boss was very particular and fastidious; but, he would never explain to me what specific things he wanted done before I sent him my already finalized deliverable. (If you want something done a particular way, I certainly understand that; but if so, you must communicate that desire in advance.) In my whole time there, the longest email instructions I received from my manager were probably ~2 sentences long. That isn't hyperbole. How can you work successfully in such an opaque environment? In all my official WorkDay reviews I received thumbs up and heard that I was doing great. That happened at 2 months, 6 months, etc; then, at one year I was sent a surprise email outside of WorkDay basically saying I'm not meeting expectations, which set up the stage for me to be fired a couple weeks later -no notice, no further explanation. The way I was treated at Ryan was very unprofessional and I did not enjoy my experience. I say this not out of spite but because its my actual experience. I hope you find this truthfulness helpful. Read other reviews and I think you'll start to see a pattern....
The only good thing I say about my experience is that my co-workers were friendly, kind and always helpful. Management? the opposite."

It feels embarrassing pushing sales of products that customers do not need onto them , when they have called in for help and are telling you how worried they are about their businesses in the current climate. 
The pressure placed is immense with no regard for staff mental health, whilst there are regular 'Your Voice' surveys sent around no change is ever made. The voices of those working with the customer service roles go unheard, when plucking up the courage to speak to management every struggle is dismissed and rather than being supported you are viewed as a problem.
There has been no effort made at all within the customer service job to make things any better for people during the WFH period.
Sage was a much better place when the focus was on actually helping the customer rather than sales, leave that to the sales team."

On my last paycheck, they paid me £400 less than I was meant to receive, but they had locked me out of the HR centre where I would be able to view my paycheck as I was leaving. I was advised to call the HR department but they literally NEVER answer the phone. Only after a manager actually dealt with it did I get paid any more, but I was still paid £30 short. Getting hugely underpaid on your last month's paycheck is a really common issue, and Sainsbury's make it very difficult for you to chase up anyone about it. So just be prepped for that as it was a horrible note to leave on."

- So many processes and bureaucracy that it gets in the way of you doing a job. No process for simple or complex actions is linear and you always have to build in time for a delay or something not being approved because of a minor non-material point. Processes are needed, but they are not streamlined, well explained and are genuinely time consuming.
- Induction was terrible - do some modules, have a 45 minute meeting with other new starters.
- Where some teams/individuals won't help there is constant need for chasing and escalation. Understandable given the workload but indicates poor resourcing by the bank. 
- IT systems leave a lot to be desired.
- Too many meetings where you repeat what you said in the previous meeting to be taken forward to the next meeting on the same subject."

I know several great employees who have quit because they refused to kiss management’s butt! And because they are an ‘at-will’ employer, they will fabricate stories to get rid of anyone that they cannot manipulate. I have seen it happen too many times!

They have been known on SEVERAL occasions to lay employees off, with absolutely NO notice! And, when they do rehire, they will hire new people instead of the ones who were laid off!

I have never worked for a company so unprofessional. They even rehired a guy who had been previously terminated for sexually harassing two different women. And, if that isn’t ridiculous enough, they had two managers who both had federal offenses against them.

Good incentives.
Brilliant colleagues.","From the very beginning I knew that their mental health policies/show boating was purely superficial.
I advised an academy manager of my poor mental health and was advised that everyone felt that way and it was normal. 
Little to no support from a lot of the managers when it comes to mental health and if you try to take some time away you’re faced with absence hearings and “sanctions” which is enough to raise anyone’s anxiety.
I knew people in the Glasgow call centre that had been sanctioned because they were off following the loss of their parents... explain to me how that is promoting mental health awareness?
In the 2.5 years I worked there the bonus structure changed multiple times to the point we are now capped. I went from earning 800+ monthly to only being able to earn 620 maximum. Which was a massive change to my income especially during a pandemic when everyone is struggling.
I’m thankful to whoever went to the police and local government in regards to the response of the pandemic because they cared very little for the safety of their employees at the start of the pandemic. I can’t believe a company as large as sky did not have any form of contingency plan if we were required to work from home.

They *promote* people who are 6 months into the job that are clueless to raise the next batch of agents to show what a brilliant opportunity sky is and that you will progress. 

The reality is that people in there that are genuinely fantastic at their job are over looked for years on end. It gets to the point that most stop applying for role model or SIM because it’s too disheartening to be rejected again because someone with the right face has came along.

Also sending bullies to work for other areas of the business because they get reported is not helping and only dissuades people from reporting power hungry managers and bullies. 

It’s a shame because some of the managers are genuinely amazing. If it wasn’t for my previous manager I would have left less than a year into the role.

The final nail in the coffin was when I was off for a period of time struggling with grief and depression when I requested a Occ Health app to discuss options for change in hours/less strict stats I was told occ health would not be able to do anything for me.

Also on my final day my new manager didn’t bother to show me out the building and hasn’t bothered to contact me since to apologise or thank me for my time. I was a hard worker and my sales were fantastic. I deserved better."

Lots of room to grow if you're interested in self-development.","Specsavers stores are franchises so work environment can be very different. I've worked in a branch that was so awful and toxic. Store partners encouraged gossiping, enabled unprofessional behaviour, and were underpaying staff. In addition, the partners only cared about making money and would understaff the shop floor on purpose to make it more ""fun"" for everyone."
Specsavers,2021-05-11, Optical Dispenser,Former Employee,"Grimsby, England, England",1,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,x,r,x,Shambles,"Worked with some great other colleagues
Some very capable and fair people in middle management","Many if not all of the problems here stem from a set of directors who seem to be completely oblivious as to how their staff feel. In my time at Specsavers, I saw petty, personal reactions from them in response to quite innocuous behaviour from staff, or scathing replies to genuine concerns raised by hardworking team members, who would go above and beyond whilst being short staffed and overworked, to ensure customers had the best experience possible.

Never, in any job I have had, has the disparity between work level and wage been so stark. The bonus scheme that was once in place, made it a little easier to make ends meet, but they rolled that back to a paltry £25 a week, which would only be paid if an increasingly challenging target was met. Both Grimsby and Cleethorpes stores are understaffed, when this issue has been raised one director in particular outright shot it down and even belittled staff for bringing it up. What he seemingly fails to have taken into account is that staff aren't simply serving customers, but answering a constantly ringing phone, booking appointments, chasing up jobs from other days, general housekeeping and so on and so forth. 

This doesn't surprise me, as his detachment from the shop floor and the feelings and morale of the staff has become a bit of a running joke, so dire is the situation. In a couple of instances, there are some very inept people in management also, who's only role seems to be to delegate to others whilst trying to look busy. Management is a mixed bag though, as there are at least 3 people within those stores who do a phenomenal job and are loved and respected by the staff.

They only take on new staff through the apprentice scheme as some sort of money saving tactic, rather than more experienced people, which only exacerbates the issues the existing staff have. Why anyone would be attracted to that apprenticeship scheme is beyond me, as the money is a poverty wage and there's nothing at the end of it, other than a minimum wage job with Specsavers.

Some mornings we would have these farcical training sessions, where exhausted and fed up staff would be given Pritt Sticks and glitter and told to make pretty posters, and lectured about customer service from people who hadn't seen a shop floor in years. 

I have never worked in a place so roundly despised by staff, and whenever concerns are raised, the attitude seems to be ""well if you don't like it, there's the door""

The door seems to be the option staff are increasingly looking to take.

I would strongly advise against anyone working at Specsavers Grimsby and Cleethorpes."

In particular in terms of systems and also what has felt like repeated waves of restructurings across both the front-office and sales.
Business momentum has also been poor, and consequently remuneration has been very tough with pay close-to-frozen for a number of years. Repeated comments by very senior management since the merger that uncompetitive pay for juniors would be addressed has come to nothing. Also a lack of clarity for more senior team members as to what performance will result in better reward.

The big concern of mine - people simply aren’t ‘promoted from within’ anywhere near enough as they should.

High performing individuals (and not to be big headed, but I would include myself in this category as I do work extremely hard in my job) just don’t seem to get picked when it comes down to a ‘final 3’ for a job.

It’s almost common practice now that if a Divisional Manager or recruitment ‘decision maker’ knows a ‘
friend or previous colleague who is at another dealer or dealer group, that has applied for a job, they automatically get it. 
It feels pointless applying for jobs within because of this.

If you are asked to apply - apply for the job
If you are not approached - don’t bother

At the age of 20 (if you join at 18) you could be earning adecent wage and have been payed well to become qualified in your chosen field. 
You will make mates that you will have for life and overall the the best thing about the Army is your peers. Once your trained the army will then give you the experience to go with your qualification, which is perfect for when you inevitably want to leave. Whilst new and keen, volunteer for as much stuff as possible. Courses, sports and Adventure training are all amazing things the Army offers so don't let them pass you by. The Army is as good as you make it. Be sociable and have pride in your work and the next 6-8 years will be great.","The reason I say enjoy the 6-8 years, is because that's how long it takes for the ridiculously outdated traditions and rules, along with the lack of communication between Higher ups who sit next to eachother.
When you first you essentially get told that if they are a higher rank than you then you do what they say because they have done more leadership courses/served more time than you have. Now even though these are valid points, from what I've seen more rank does not mean better leader, or that they have any form of leadership at all. This results in unintelligent power hungry Superiors who, if you stand up to the tyranny, will mess you about as much as possible. Guess what because the army pays you 24/7, means you can get messed about whenever they want. Had plans for the weekend? Doesn't matter, you stood up to a bully with 2 bananas so you don't deserve a weekend. 
A truly good Senior is hard to come by, because all the good people have the sense to leave. The rest are either a slave to the wage, or have been so indoctrinated that they can't adapt to civvie Street, so they treat others like they were treated and the cycle continues.
There Is only so much you can do. Doesn't matter if your great at your job, they will treat you like your just a number, because that is what you are."

Not even one good thing.,"This is quite simply the worst job I've ever had. At first they paint a happy picture, telling you it's a family and coming across really nice, but it changes as soon as you start to work for them. 

Unless you work on the checkout, this job is hard work and they like to think you're a robot. A usual day working on a department includes working stock, being called to the till to sort issues out, and being bullied by management. You are expected to unload all the pallets of stock which are usually 6 to 7 feet tall with around 30 to 40 boxes of stock, sometimes we can have up to three of these. If you are on your own, you are expected to at least unload around two pallets of stock in a 6 hour shift and get them on the shelves as fast as possible. It isn't that simple though, you are called to the till numerous times during your shift to get items with barcodes or sort pricing issues out. Within your 6 hour shift, you are also expected to clean your department which can be a hard task when you are pushed to get stock out as quickly as possible. 

Management are bullies. At my store, there was a particular manager who was vile for no reason, and in my opinion, shouldn't be in a role such as the one she is in. I heard from numerous colleagues that she had driven people out of the company due to the way she talks to people. She doesn't treat anyone with respect but expects you to continue being subservient. Management also makes errors such as ones regarding hours. Sometimes you aren't given your contracted hours on your rota and if they find out you haven't worked your contracted hours, they blame you for it even though it is their fault for not rostering the right hours, it's also a challenge to chase them up about it as they just do not care.

Chances are you won't get paid properly either. When the minimum wages goes up, they don't pay you the new wage until a month after and then they dont give you the missing amount in the next payslip.

Colleagues are horrible and sly for no good reason and think they're above everyone because they've worked there longer. You also get the typical gossipers who will grass you out to the managers the first chance they get.

I left after just 7 weeks because in that time I had been bullied by management and it just generally wasn't good for my mental health

- lack of integrity with career development opportunities— your merit means nothing if you’re not liked by all of leadership
- Hypocrisy, bias & lack of logic in key decision making 
- “Growth opportunities” are a mask for saving a buck to not backfill critical roles and dump onto existing employees who are rockstars, without any reward, leading to burnout 
- Preach about wanting “disturbers to shake things up & think different” but reprimand them when they do 
- leadership team promoting wellness & career development with no authentic-ness behind it, just to check a box

In general, this is a solid company to work for. There will always be work, so you'll never run out of things to do. There are frequent opportunities to develop laterally if that's your thing, you can learn new skills directly from the people who do that work for a living.

The pay is good for the industry and benefits are generous. We also got a $1000 WFH allowance to buy a desk/chair, a monitor, etc. The transition to WFH was seamlessand in general, management are attentive of work-life balance and will encourage you to take holiday if you need it.","We're moving away on all fronts from what made Unity unique and different from companies like Unreal. I remember when our mission was still to support small indie devs in bringing their vision to life. That's not the case anymore, it's all aggressive marketing over product quality.

Since we became a public company, every move internally and externally has been towards less transparency to users and internally and more corporate obstacles like more middle management and a centralized undemocratic environment.

Unity now makes it mandatory to install spyware and tracking applications on your work machines. Until last year, your machine was your machine and the company treated you like an adult capable of securing a laptop. They tried to roll this out without even notifying people at first, which directly went against our value of transparency.

Development is in chaos. We have far too many tech streams between the core editor and packages, releases can happen any time and you'll never know if a package released from another team will break the thing you're working on. Communication could be improved by a lot. If we had a vision it would be one thing, but right now we have a few different competing visions and that weaknes us overall.

Resources allocation is another problem for both human resources and teams funding. Critical systems are supported by tiny teams and non essential but flashy systems get most of the monye.

But the biggest disappointment to me, as a long time Unity employee, is how the company has started dealing with serious internal issues. Before, if you had a problem with someone, you could talk it out and resolve it and HR would help you mediate if necessary. Now, if something serious happens, like prolonged harrassment or abuse, we have an HR department whose only job is to protect the company and the abuser. Sure they tell you the spiel that they will talk to the abuser and coach him or her on how to be less toxic, but then the toxic behavior doesn't stop and subsequent complaints fall on deaf ears. They even try to discredit you or convince you that the problem lies with you, the complainant, and not with the person whose behavior is actually the problem. Gaslighting and isolating victims also supports this practice. How a company handles these unfrequent but serious incidents defines who that company wants to be. At this stage, Unity has failed some of its most vulnerable employees and that, more than anything, says a lot about how much gas changed."

Unity-Technologies,2021-02-10, Senior Advocate,Current Employee,"London, England, England",5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,v,v,v,Amazing place to work,"Some of the core values Unity tries to embrace are ""Best Idea Wins"", ""Go Bold"" and ""In It Together"". I've worked at many companies whose values are allegedly good, but don't actually take action on them. In contrast, Unity seems to really invest in these ideas. They deliver Active Listening training to leaders. They have a whole range of social events. They even have an entire Wellbeing team dedicated to running clubs and socials, sending gifts, and so on (so these responsibilities don't fall on the shoulders of people who are juggling this with other work)! They also have several Employee Resource Groups for people in marginalised groups (like a BIPOC one, an LGBTQ+ one, a women's ERG, and so on). Sustainability is also a core concern, with much discussion and events happening around that.

Every team is managed differently, so your experience may vary, but I am given lots of freedom to shape my job to fit myself, rather than change myself to fit the role. I can explore different technologies, collaborate across the organisation, and get involved in a wide variety of work.

The work is interesting and generously compensated (both in terms of salary and holiday allowance); the people are brilliantly smart, talented, and excellent listeners; and the technology is cutting-edge and exciting to work with. It's the most positive and inspirational workplace I've ever had the pleasure of working at.","Sometimes too many meetings, especially during the pandemic (as it's a big organisation).

If you're not from a corporate background, the jargon can be off-putting. There is a jargon glossary though!

Many different systems for different tasks. Not a huge problem, just a lot to learn when you first arrive.

Sometimes things are moving so fast, it feels as if we haven't finished one product/solution before we're working on or shipping the next one, which can damage credibility with users (e.g. if something ships with bugs)"

Many more unprofessional behavior."
Unity-Technologies,2020-12-20, Technical Recruiter,Former Employee,"Bellevue, WA",4,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,x,v,v,Life is like a box of chocolates...and so is Unity.,"The Product, the CEO, and the vast majority of the people.

I've always believed that recruiting becomes much easier when you are passionate and knowledgeable about the product your company creates. Sprinkle in a customer service focus and point that toward your candidates and clients and you have the beginnings of a recipe for success. 

Add to that a great CEO; someone with a strong vision and someone you trust to do the right thing for the employees and (at least on the surface) you have the makings of a wonderful company.

As with most companies, at Unity, it's all about the team or the group you land within. Arguably, Unity has significantly more ""good apples"" than ""bad apples"" in terms of teams/groups so even the risk-averse should feel comfortable considering Unity.","Recruiting Leadership.

The culture that I was passionate about is being systematically removed by processes brought in a year ago by the new VP of Recruiting that force a focus on KPIs/metrics. While I agree that KPIs and/or metrics certainly have their place in a world that is all about numbers, ""how"" you use those numbers can make or break a recruiting organization.

In Unity's current model, hiring for culture fit becomes a secondary and oftentimes overlooked part of the equation because of the pressure to get hires. Much like trying to hire for inclusiveness, hiring for culture requires a deliberate approach, and if, as a recruiter, you need to decide between increasing your volume of hires to keep your job or focusing on making the ""right"" hires the choice is obvious. Invariably, over time, the original heart and soul of the company changes, or even worse, disappears. I specifically made the choice to leave Unity because the culture was becoming something I no longer recognized and related to.

Is Unity the right place for you? If you're a recruiter and you like to approach your job with the mentality of quality over quantity, Unity might not be the place for you. If you're a recruiter coming from an agency and you're looking for that first corporate opportunity that will act as a stepping stone, Unity will be very familiar to you."

Employees respect each other. Not just due to grass-roots peer-to-peer respect, but mutual respect is a core piece of how leadership pushes the company forward.
The executive level leadership is transparent, honest, and humble. Despite recently IPO'ing, the leadership remains long-term focused, and employee focused. They are not cutting corners, cutting benefits, or reducing the level to which they listen to the company at large.","As we grow, we are slowly learning to be a larger company. Early on, Unity was entirely engineering driven. In that world, one- or two-engineer teams would spin up to solve problems. This led to a very agile and quick moving company, but we have somewhat out grown that. For one, our problems are often too big for just one or two engineers to hop-on then hop-off. Second, we have too many engineers to avoid repeat, overlapping, or conflicting work, if they all work on whatever pops up. 
Overall we are headed in a good direction. We are remaining engineering & bottoms-up driven, while building infrastructure to support larger teams, and larger communication efforts. The con here is that we're still learning how to do this. How many people are needed in roles like product or program management? How do large and disjoint teams divide up giant initiatives? And, how do we balance supporting legacy systems and developing new ones?"

1. Colleagues are all genuinely very nice and willing to help
2. Onboarding process is very organized
3. WFH and wellness allowances

I believe that when you're going through the interview process, not only is the company interviewing you, but you're also interviewing the company. From day one, the senior recruiter, Sarah Rideout, was amazing. My first touch point and I was sold! She notified me every step of the way, who I wold be meeting with next, what type of interview it would be, the duration of the interview -- all so that I could come prepared. I've never had an HR team be so welcoming and transparent! Really appreciated the process. 

Going through the onboarding process, it's the best one I've experienced to date. Keeping in mind, I joined the company during the pandemic and everything is done remotely. There's ample amount of ways you can self-educate, and everything is at your own place. If you are self-sufficient and a curious person, you will love the onboarding process. 

Last but not least, my team mates have been nothing but generous and kind. Everyone I've met to date is living and breathing Unity's values. It's refreshing to meet like-minded individuals that are all working towards common goals.","I haven't ran into any yet, but I'm still fairly new so this could change!"

The union and student services are fantastic. Although the mental health services could do with being bigger and better funded (as they all do) the level of service from the counsellors is excellent. There is also active encouragement on a university and department level to identify what training would benefit you and depending on your funding source there's is an expectation to spend some of your assigned funding on external training as well as internal.,"Experience doing a PhD will vary hugely depending on your research group and supervisors. For me I felt lacking support at times and ultimately left the position after 3 years as a result. I find some professors are significantly lacking in interpersonal skills and as such I felt unable to talk with them about some more personal sides to my PhD such as my mental health. 

The way the mental health services are set up meant at the time I was most struggling I was given a small number of sessions (with the possibility of entending if the counsellor felt it was necessary). After that you could refer again for more help. You definitely got the impression that counsellors were strectched thin and could only achieve so much with the resources they have. I felt a bit like putting a plaster over the problem each time and I had to go elsewhere for a more in-depth, lengthier treatment plan."

- Highly diverse and inclusive working culture.","- Tier pay scheme creates extreme seasonality and huge fluctuations in salaries. In the winter months, you can likely deliver in excess of 30 sessions a week at above £25. However, in the summer months, as families go abroad, you have no security and are likely to drop down a tier or two as your weekly sessions could possibly drop below 20. With huge fluctuations in salary, you can expect to be earning less than £20 per hour compared to £25 previously at no fault of your own.

- Limited scope for development. New PT's especially have limited support other than a workshop upon signing with Virgin Active. The companies focus is fixated on sales and fails to register or recognise the importance of personal branding and longevity.

Whilst sales are an important metric, management encourages PT's to offer additional sessions alongside the packages offered to clients to entice a purchase. This means for what we call a '4-pack', four sessions at a fixed price, we are encouraged to offer 5 or six, with the additional sessions coming off our own back, not the companies.

- Political, I can speak with experience and suggest this does not apply to all Virgin Active's, however, in-house politics can intensely affect the leads you are given as a PT. Management, once a month, used to give a list of new members so that we could cold call and see if they were interested in PT sessions. However, these lists were always given to the 'favourite' PT to begin with who would take over 50% of the leads whilst the remaining were segregated among the rest of us. We had eight PT's in our team."

Great members & fun environment
Some really nice employees who didn't pay attention to the cliques","Poor pay - we were paid the personal trainer rate, which made no sense given that the PT team made extra money from their sessions. Only about $35k a year for full time, long hours & weekend work
High demand from employees - I had a surgery in my first couple of weeks & was told I would need to work the day after because it was so early on in my contract. I was so drugged up I eventually had to be sent home. There was also nobody who would cover my shift when my dog died so I spent the day on reception crying.
Difficult hours - 5:30am - 1:30pm, 11:00am - 7:00pm or 1:30pm - 9:30pm & weekends
Poor management - one of the managers really disliked me & when she moved into a higher position, performance managed me out, nit-picking & making it near impossible to perform well. I did do some things wrong that I learnt from, though it was awfully managed
Toxic culture - a lot of the trainers were blindly mean. One of the receptionists once bluntly stated the clique there had no bothered being friendly to me in the first 6 months because they were so used to people coming & going they didn't bother making new friendships until you'd been there 'long enough'
Impossible standards - the VA group had 5 values they asked everyone to stick by & unless you were EXACTLY this person, they didn't pay attention to you or encourage development
Awful member conditions - VA originally had a policy that if you wanted to suspend / freeze your membership, it had to be for 2 fortnightly debit cycles totalling 4 weeks. When members would question why they couldn't freeze for only 2 weeks, VA Head Office never provided a reasonable justification other than it was 'admin heavy'. There was zero justifiable reason to do it this way & resulted in a lot of frustrated members. Eventually they changed it to being able to suspend for only 2 weeks & it made the admin so much easier because people wouldn't have to cancel their suspensions when, for example, they returned from holidays & wanted to use the gym."

Additionally, mattresses can be purchased at significant discount through the supply chain. 

There are two excellent restaurants on site at the Dunstable Support Centre, both managed by an external company. This is subsidised, although still a little pricey, but the staff are friendly and the food excellent. You can easily have your main meal for the day here every day of the week if you wish as there is plenty of variety.","Whitbread frequently misrepresent advertised roles to get job seekers through the front door. Unfortunately, I was told about their ‘reputation’ in this regard by a recruiter after I had left a great job to join Whitbread on the promise of opportunities for professional advancement. My role was not representative of what was advertised at all, which I later found to be a shared experience for the majority of my technical colleagues. 

Within IT the above is seemingly due to hiring managers not being technically aware. They frequently apply technical terms, but with an understanding which conflicts with those that are actual IT professionals. Managers generally lack any technical capability whatsoever and have achieved their position due to office cliques as opposed to experience or merit. Consequently, most techies leave within two years as it’s a constant uphill battle to get the most basic tasks completed. 

Those that don’t leave Whitbread IT out of frustration, management or antiquated process generally find themselves at risk of redundancy during one of the yearly restructures. Often these are the very same people hired to bring in their skills to help improve the state of IT as a whole. Worse still redundant roles have a tendency to re-appear on job boards weeks later with only the most minor of changes in job description. An indirect consequence of this is that the departments relationship with the current MSP is extremely toxic due a total lack of any continuity of ownership internally.

Providers are frequently blamed for these internal shortcomings openly within meetings in a rude an entirely unprofessional manner. They are also frequently used as a scapegoat by staff at all levels who are unwilling to take any personal accountability for poor state of IT services, which they are supposed to both manage and support. The behaviours demonstrated are truly contemptable, those that speak out or try to present a more balanced perspective are promptly bullied into submission or simply find themselves excluded from all conversations where they could really add value.

Sadly, I cannot recommend working here, as ‘The Whitbread Way’ (a term used by managers to say ‘that’s just how it is here’) will really disagree with IT professionals. Seeing a problem and envisaging a sound technical solution will be argued every single step of the way. The IT department is a real dead-end here, there is no scope to learn or grow whilst those in positions of power abuse it constantly whilst refusing to listen to those skilled workers who genuinely joined with a strong desire to improve products and services."

Premier Inn discounts","If local management is bad, it's going to be unbearable. Even formal complaints get brushed under the rug, as if managers have friends at other local locations, they review it first and will quash it long before it'll reach anyone in HR, or even an area manager (not mine, happened with 3/4 people at the location). Managers bring in their friends to work, so creates a cronyistic atmosphere and personal biases. But, a well run location can be great all the same. So it's very much luck of the draw. They have a tendency to bring in young, 'hot shot' team leader/managers, who think being a good manager is liking to hear the sound of their own voice, or sitting on their phone doing nothing, and then nagging staff for not doing more, so yeah, hit or miss depending on location"

HQ in Dunstable is a very different story. There are *some* people trying to do the right thing, they are just up against a political culture and some very old fashioned thinking from an ageing leadership team.

In IT, the pay is generally pretty competitive considering it is based in the middle of nowhere and the discounts were good for staff. The coffee in head office is passable","Its an oversized, slow moving, risk adverse business. Everything costs millions (when it need not) and everything takes years. The senior executives are highly political with continual shake ups and people cut from the business left right and centre. The board has individuals who are from the nineties and the imported Tesco, burn-all-bridges career strategy cut means there are few team members safe any more.

In IT there is a dependency on a useless outsource partner that is unhealthy and so expensive it makes your eyes water but there is no action to improve things. There is a disjointed experience for those working in the swanky London office vs Dunstable and layers of management and bureaucracy are added to every piece of work making it such-hard-work to get things done. People still wear suits to work (although this was changing while I was there) and the attitude towards diversity is so poor that the unsaid joke about White-bread would be funny if it wasn't so painfully true."

During the first lockdown not only did they top up furlough payments for all its team the company continually find moments of truth to better employee wellbeing.

- Weak career development, success and moving up is a politics game. If you want to do right by the customer and not follow leaderships opinion, you can be moved teams and put on awful projects until you’re pushed out. 
- There’s no focus on the customer, it’s all about pleasing your stakeholders and developing their wish list. During my first weeks, a rather senior leader told me if I didn’t please my stakeholders and make sure they got their wishes, they’d make sure I didn’t last long. 
- Uninspiring projects and features which consist of moving the product as is from an old tech stack to new. In some cases, the new tech is poor and the feature set is reduced and regressed.

Good workers are constantly doing older employees jobs because they're comfortable there and know they wont get fired."

As a fan of Lego all my life, I felt no shame or discomfort making sales. Lego is something you can happily recommend to others so long as they can afford it.

The store generally attracts open-minded and fun potential employees and customers. You'll find yourself making good friends there with the sales associates and regular customers.

You will gain a lot of self-confidence here. Whilst the job role of always having to put on a big smile and a circus-act can seem unfitting and annoying at times to your personality, you really see that happiness reflected in the eyes and faces of customers and it does make your day. 

Hey, the employee discount is pretty nice.","As the headline suggests, it's just retail. Having to deal with Lego and friendly customers pacifies your experience and makes it bearable. 

Pay is low, not that there's anything much to expect out of a sales associate in retail. 

You will be berated by managers and supervisors over minor issues. You leave and begin shifts in fear, paranoid you've done something wrong. 

You will turn up to shifts only to have managers tell you in a briefing that 'it's your fault that we're not meeting unrealistic sales numbers'.

You aren't allowed to talk with fellow sales associates on the shop floor. No really, not even five seconds of it. Managers and assistant managers will come running to get their buzz out of berating you for it.

Managers live in fear of senior management/corporate and only push the blame down on to you. It's quite laughable when you're told to be on your 'best behaviour' because Senior Management is visiting, and when they do arrive, just based on first-impressions, they're nothing to write home about. As I said, systems of fear.

NPS system which rates you based on the reviews from customer survey feedback (the link on their receipt). A system which is already inaccessible, inconvenient and meaningless to most customers actually determines how your managers review your performance. So you need to beg customers to fill it out at the till otherwise it would 'seem' as if you're not even doing your job correctly. Surely the managers should be able to assess your performance with their own eyes and ears on the shop floor. 

You'll have to do an hour of 'greet' at the door every shift which is outdated and mind-numbing. Admittedly, having been greeted before, I can understand why it sets a good mood, but it really isn't a necessity and can really drive down the mental wellbeing of your staff on their shifts.

Delivery shifts are tiring and set unrealistic targets. Sadly it's the only time you'll get to be social as it's all mostly back-of-house.  

As with most retail stores, the music choice is terrible.

I do often feel nostalgic about working there, but I only realise now that I just miss the friends I made. I am glad to be away from everything else. As for the Lego bit, I can enjoy that from the warmth of my own home."
